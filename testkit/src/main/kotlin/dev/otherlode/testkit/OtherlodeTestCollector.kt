/**
 * An embeddable collector that speaks the same wire protocol the Otherlode agent sends: delta
 * batches, probe manifests, and static baselines, all protobuf over plain HTTP. An adopter's test
 * runs the real agent against [endpoint] and then asks this collector what it saw, instead of
 * querying any in-process registry.
 *
 * Every class name in this API is the dotted binary name the manifest carries: for example
 * `com.acme.OrderService`, `com.acme.OrdersKt` for a Kotlin file's top-level functions, or
 * `com.acme.Outer$Inner` for a nested class.
 *
 * A probe query for a class or method this collector has never heard of throws
 * [UnknownProbeException] rather than reading as "confirmed never hit". Collapsing "genuinely
 * dead" and "we have no idea" into the same `false` would be exactly the silent, confident, wrong
 * failure mode the rest of this agent is built to avoid.
 *
 * Endpoint queries ([wasCalled], [callCount], [neverCalled], [endpoints]) follow the same rule,
 * throwing [UnknownEndpointException] for a `(verb, route template)` no manifest has mentioned.
 * An endpoint's identity is the pair alone, never `endpoint_id`: `endpoint_id` is assigned
 * independently by each instance's own registry, so an endpoint registered by several instances
 * merges into one [EndpointRef] whose call count sums every instance's latest total, the same
 * cross-instance aggregation [hitCount] already does for method probes by class and method name.
 *
 * Dependency queries ([dependency], [unloadedDependencies], [unreferencedDependencies],
 * [unreachedDependencies], [absentReferences]) apply the collector's dependency rules within this
 * one test JVM and follow the same rule again: a dependency no manifest has listed throws
 * [UnknownDependencyException], and a question the data cannot answer yet, or at all without a
 * complete static baseline, throws [IllegalStateException] instead of returning an empty list.
 * The agent sends a dependency's entry only after its loaded-class counts have been delivered, so
 * [dependency] answers once the entry arrives. The four list queries answer only once every
 * instance heard from has sent `dependencies_listed`; [awaitDependenciesListed] waits for that.
 *
 * Every probe, endpoint and dependency is keyed on its instance id alone, not on the run id every
 * payload carries. That is the same as keying on the run only while each instance id names one
 * run, which holds when this collector hears from the one agent in its own test JVM. A payload with
 * an empty run id, or with a second run id under an instance id this collector has already heard
 * from, would break that assumption. Such a payload is answered 400, nothing from it is kept, and
 * the reason is recorded in [rejectedPayloads]. A payload that does not decode, or that fails
 * while it is applied, is treated the same way. From then on [awaitSettled] and every other
 * query and wait throw [IllegalStateException] listing the recorded reasons, so a test fails
 * even if it never calls [rejectedPayloads].
 *
 * Close this with [close], typically from a `.use { }` block, once a test is done with it.

     * Kotlin caller copies the body into its own call site instead of invoking it, so a zero hit
     * total is not evidence the code never ran.
     *

     * what the adopter does, so a zero hit total on a data class's `copy`, an enum's `values`, or
     * the like is not a finding the adopter can act on.
     *
     * An optional-argument probe is left out too, whatever its own count: an omission probe
     * reading zero means a parameter is never omitted, which is [alwaysSupplied], not dead code.
     *
     * The class-finding rules apply as well. A `<clinit>` is never listed, since it is a class
     * state. A constructor is listed only as an unused overload, when another constructor of its
     * class ran. A method that can only run through a class finding ([neverInitialised],

     * such a method or a never-hit method listed here. A BRANCH probe in a method left out this way
     * is left out too.
     *
     * A branch site inside code that never ran folds into the row for that code: every BRANCH probe
     * of the site is left out. A site folds when its method was never hit, even a method that is
     * not a row itself such as a lone constructor, or when its guard, the innermost outcome in the
     * same method that must run before the site is reached, is a never-hit outcome that would be a
     * row but for this fold. A guard outcome whose own site folded still counts, so a site two
     * levels under a never-taken outcome folds too. A routine guard folds nothing, since a routine
     * outcome is in no finding, and neither does a guard that ran.
     *
     * A routine outcome is left out too, since nothing about it is worth acting on: the agent read
     * from the bytecode that the outcome only yields a null default, only throws, or is the
     * exception-path copy of a `finally` body. [neverHitRoutineOutcomes] lists those.
     *
     * An unread shape is left out too: a method whose body has the outline of compiler output but
     * matches no shape the agent has read, a branch probe in such a method, and an outcome the agent
     * marked unread. That is a fact about the agent, not about the adopter's code.

     * The graph holds three kinds of node. A method node comes from a manifest METHOD probe, merged
     * across instances with hits summed, or from a non-inline declared method of a class a complete
     * static baseline declared but no manifest ever mentioned. Such a method carries
     * [ProbeRef.neverLoaded] `true`, line `-1`, and the declaring instance's id. An outcome node is
     * a BRANCH probe with no hits, merged across instances by its method and branch index, in a
     * method node with hits. A BRANCH probe that is inline or generated is never an outcome node,
     * by the rule that keeps its method out of the graph. A class node is a class that holds a
     * class finding: never loaded, [neverInitialised] or [neverInstantiated]. It stands for the
     * never-hit methods that finding covers, which are never method nodes of their own. For a
     * never-loaded class that is every method node of the class.
     *
     * A call edge whose guard names an outcome node counts as a call from that outcome node. Every
     * other edge counts as a call from its method, or from the class node that stands for it. An
     * edge into a covered method goes into its class node, and an edge between two methods one class
     * node stands for is dropped. An outcome node has one caller: the outcome node its site's guard
     * names, or else its method. Within one JVM a guard's branch index names one outcome of the
     * caller's class, so it is looked up there directly.
     *
     * A root is a never-hit node with no caller or with a caller that is a method with hits, a
     * generated method with hits included, since code outside scope may call it. A method
     * root with no caller is [RootKind.UNCALLED], and one with a caller that has hits is
     * [RootKind.REACHED_FROM_HIT]. An outcome root is [RootKind.UNTAKEN_OUTCOME], and a class root is
     * [RootKind.CLASS_FINDING]. A `<clinit>` is never a root, and neither is an unjudged constructor:
     * a never-hit `<init>` of a loaded class no instance constructed that no class finding covers,
     * such as a utility class's private constructor. Like `<clinit>`, it is reached through but never
     * listed or counted, and a class is listed whole without it. The cluster is the root plus every
     * never-hit node reachable from it whose every caller is already in the cluster. An outcome or
     * class root whose cluster holds no method or class node besides the root gives no cluster,
     * since the root's own finding already says all there is.
     *
     * Inline methods are never nodes, so an edge into one resolves to nothing. Edges are the union
     * of manifest and complete-baseline call edges. Resolution walks a callee's owner up through
     * [supertypesByClassName] and complete-baseline supertypes to the first type with a matching

     * under some ancestor. Each resolved call keeps its raw edge's guard.
     * Every resolved edge into a class also implies an edge into that class's `<clinit>` node
     * when it has one, under the same guard: no bytecode ever calls `<clinit>`, the JVM runs it on
     * the class's first active use, and a resolved call into the class is exactly such a use.
     * Without this a never-initialised class's `<clinit>` would be an uncalled root of its own

     * A generated method is no node but is not a dead end either: a lookup that lands on one
     * continues along that method's own edges, resolved the same way, so the call reaches what
     * the generated code runs. A Kotlin `-jvm-default=disable` stub is the case that needs it: a
     * call typed as the interface widens down to each implementing class's stub, which is
     * generated, and only the stub's edge reaches the default's code in `$DefaultImpls`. A
     * generated method with hits is a caller in its own right, since code outside scope can call
     * it, as a `HashMap` calls a data class's `hashCode`: its calls are resolved the same way and
