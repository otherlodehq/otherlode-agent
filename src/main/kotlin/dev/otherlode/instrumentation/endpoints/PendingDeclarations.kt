/**
 * Holds endpoint registrations a module made while ByteBuddy was rewriting a class, until that
 * rewrite is known to have succeeded.
 *
 * A module that reads its routes off a class's own annotations declares them from inside the
 * transform callback, which ByteBuddy runs before it rewrites and validates the bytes. Declaring
 * straight into the registry there publishes endpoints for a class that may still fail to weave:
 * the class then serves requests with no advice on it, the endpoint's hit count stays at zero,
 * and a collector reads "never called" for a route the framework is serving. Probes face the same
 * hazard and get the same answer: hold the declarations, and commit them only once the rewrite has
 * produced bytes.
 *
 * One slot per thread, with no key. ByteBuddy runs the transform callback, the rewrite and the
 * result callbacks back to back on the loading thread, and its `CircularityLock` holds a
 * per-thread entry throughout, so one thread has at most one class in flight.
 *
 * A module that declares its routes at runtime instead, by walking a framework object once the
 * application has built it, is not staging: no transform is in flight on that thread, [stage]
 * declines the work, and the caller registers directly.

     * once per matching module rather than once per class. Only the first call opens the list. A
     * later one leaves what earlier modules staged in place and reports the size, which its
     * caller keeps as the mark to [rollbackTo] if its own module throws.
     *
     * ByteBuddy's default fallback strategy can run a whole transform twice, retrying with a
     * different type description after a `LinkageError` and with no listener call in between to
     * close the list. It only retries a class being retransformed, and only when the class is
     * described from its loaded `Class` first; the endpoint pipeline describes every class from
     * its bytes, so the second pass cannot happen here. On a retransformation the pipeline rolls
     * back whatever a module declared anyway. It would be harmless regardless: declaring one
     * endpoint key twice is the same endpoint.
