/**
 * FNV-1a over a class's method and branch-site signatures.
 *
 * [dev.otherlode.instrumentation.OtherlodeInstrumentation] hands the signatures to [of]
 * in one specific order: the same order it uses to assign probe array slots. That order has to
 * matter for the hash. Otherwise, two loads of a class with the same signatures, but a different
 * declaration order, would hash the same. [dev.otherlode.registry.ProbeRegistry]
 * would then treat the layout as unchanged, and hand back the old array and old metadata. But the
 * new bytecode wires different slots to different methods and branches. Reusing the old array
 * would silently swap whose hits get attributed to which probe.
 *
 * Hashing in slot-assignment order avoids this. A reorder then produces a different hash, so the
 * registry correctly treats it as a new layout and allocates a fresh array.
