/**
 * Walks [Instrumentation.getAllLoadedClasses] to answer two questions no transformer can, one in
 * each direction.
 *
 * The forward direction ([reportUnreported]) asks which classes the agent would have instrumented,
 * had it been offered them, that the registry never heard about at all. `java.lang.instrument`
 * refuses to call a transformer while that thread is already inside another class's transform, so
 * a class loaded from inside a transform reaches no transformer, agent or otherwise, and would
 * read as never loaded next to a static baseline that declared it.
 *
 * The reverse direction ([confirm]) asks which classes the registry did hear about that the JVM
 * never actually defined: a class ByteBuddy wove and [ProbeRegistry.register] committed, where the
 * verifier then rejected the bytes or `defineClass` raised a `LinkageError` for a supertype absent
 * at load. Left alone, such a class sits in the manifest permanently at zero, which is what a
 * collector reads as dead code.
 *
 * Both directions read [Instrumentation.getAllLoadedClasses] once per [run] call and compare it
 * against the registry from opposite sides, so one sweep serves both rather than two independent
 * walks of the same array.
 *
 * The same array feeds [dependencyCounter], when one is given, which counts the distinct classes
 * loaded from each dependency.

     * The confirmation pass must see every loaded name, not the forward direction's filtered

     * never defined, which needs the raw set. A registered class the filter happens to drop would

     * it ignores reaches no transform callback and no registry bucket. An include prefix can reach
     * into the JDK's own packages (`includePackages=com` covers `com.sun.*`), and a sweep that only
     * replicated the type matcher would then call every such JDK class a blind spot, since the gate
     * turned it away before the type matcher ever saw it. The loader checks and the name-prefix
     * check here are that gate: a class on the bootstrap or platform loader, and one named under
     * ByteBuddy's own package or the reflection internals, is ignored rather than instrumented.
     *
     * The rest mirror `TypeMatchPolicy`: the synthetic flag, the name rules, the
     * runtime-generated proxy names, and the coroutine-continuation check, which needs only the
     * direct superclass's name. An array class
     * and a hidden class are dropped too, neither of which a transformer is ever offered. A hidden
     * class carries its own `/0x...` suffix in its name, so it could not be joined to anything a
     * collector holds even if it were a blind spot.
     *
     * One check from the type matcher is left out on purpose: whether the class carries an
     * annotation that is illegal on a type. Reading a class's annotations resolves each
     * annotation's own type and can load classes, and a sweep must not load anything in order to
     * look. A class turned away for that reason is recorded as skipped, so it never reaches here.
     * The same limit applies to a multi-file part. The type matcher takes that one kind of
     * synthetic class, but only its `kotlin.Metadata` tells it apart, so the sweep drops every
     * synthetic class. A part that reached no transformer is not reported.
