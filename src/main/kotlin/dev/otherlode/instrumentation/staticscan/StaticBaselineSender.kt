/**
 * Holds the static baseline chunks the collector has not yet confirmed and sends them in order.
 *
 * The scan runs once per process, so a chunk the collector never confirmed would otherwise be
 * lost for the life of the process. [StaticBaselinePublisher] offers the chunks and makes the
 * first attempt through [exporter]; [dev.otherlode.export.ExportScheduler] calls [retryPending]
 * after a flush whose own sends the collector confirmed, which is when a retry can succeed. A retry
 * runs on the flush thread, so it sends one chunk through [retryExporter], which should make one
 * attempt: a flush then holds the scheduler for one request timeout at most, and the shutdown
 * flush, which waits for it, keeps its budget.
 * A chunk that reached the collector with its answer lost is sent twice, which a collector reads
 * as one, since it keeps received chunks by index. A chunk the collector refuses for its content
 * (a 400 or 422) drops every pending chunk, since resending the same bytes would only be
 * refused again. Any other refusal keeps them, to be sent after a later flush the collector
 * confirms: a 401 while a token rotates, a 404 before a collector serves the route, a 413 since
 * a proxy's limit can be raised while the process runs.
 *
 * Only one thread sends at a time. A call that finds another sending returns at once rather than
 * wait, so the flush thread never blocks behind the scan thread's exporter backoff.
