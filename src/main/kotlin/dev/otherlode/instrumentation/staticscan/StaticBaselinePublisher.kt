/**
 * Runs one static baseline scan and publishes the result: primes the
 * [StaticBaselineMismatchDetector], sweeps the classes that already registered dynamically before
 * the scan finished, and sends the scan to the collector in chunks.
 *
 * The sweep exists because the detector can only compare a registration against a scan that has
 * completed. Every class loaded during startup, which is exactly when an app server deploys its
 * WAR, registers before this scan finishes and would otherwise never be checked at all.
 *
 * References are passed through [filterReferences] before chunking, so the chunk weights count
 * only what is sent; in the agent that is [BaselineReferenceFilter], which waits for the dependency
 * listing. Without one, or when it throws, every reference list is emptied, since unfiltered lists
 * would carry JDK names and names nothing maps, and losing the references is better than losing
 * the baseline.
 *
 * A scan holding a class too large for one chunk is not sent at all, and the agent logs one WARNING
 * that names the class and the bound; see [StaticBaselineChunker].
 *
 * Every chunk carries [includeRules], the rules the scan applied. Chunks are sent in order
 * through [sender], and the first failure stops the send. The chunks left are sent again after a
 * later flush the collector confirms; until they arrive the collector holds a partial scan, which
 * it can recognise from `chunk_count` and must not diff as if it were complete.
