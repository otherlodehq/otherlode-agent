/**
 * Filters a static scan's references and maps each one kept to its dependency, without a defining
 * loader.
 *
 * At transform time a reference is looked up through the loader defining the referencing class.
 * The scan has no such loader, and in a Spring Boot fat jar the system loader cannot see
 * `BOOT-INF/lib` at all, so this works from what the agent has already read: the scan's own class
 * names and the startup listing's class index ([DependencyRegistry.dependencyForClass]). One
 * referenced name resolves, in order:
 *
 * 1. Provided by the platform or bootstrap loader: a JDK class, dropped.
 * 2. Seen by the scan in a directory root or under `BOOT-INF/classes`/`WEB-INF/classes`: the
 *    adopter's own, dropped.
 * 3. In the class index: kept, and recorded as that dependency's.
 * 4. Seen by the scan at the root of a jar the listing did not register as a dependency (the
 *    adopter's own jar, an agent jar): dropped.
 * 5. Anything else: kept, and recorded nowhere. The scan cannot tell a class that is truly absent
 *    from one in a jar only a runtime loader will open (a plugin directory, a war's `WEB-INF/lib`),
 *    and since the first recording of a name wins, an absent verdict here would stand even after
 *    the transform path found the jar. Left unmapped, the name is ignored by a collector until the
 *    transform path maps it, if it ever does.
 *
 * Step 3 comes before step 4 because on a flat classpath the scan walks every jar, dependencies
 * included, so a name seen in a jar is the adopter's only when no dependency holds it.
 *
 * Mappings are recorded into [externalClasses], which sends each once on the manifest, so the
 * baseline carries none and never disagrees with the transform path; a name the transform path
 * recorded first keeps that recording.
 *
 * [filter] first runs [dependencyListing] if no one has, on the scan's own thread, so the scan never
 * waits for a flush that may be a minute away; then it waits up to [listingWait] for the startup
 * listing to end. If it failed or is still running, every reference list is emptied: with no
 * dependencies there is nothing to map a name to.
 * A failure is logged at INFO, a timeout at WARNING, one line either way.
