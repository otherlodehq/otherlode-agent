/**
 * Finds every [ConditionalJump], every `TABLESWITCH`/`LOOKUPSWITCH`, and every Kotlin `$default`
 * method in a class's original bytecode, plus each method's first source line.
 *
 * Only methods [methodFilter] accepts contribute branch sites, first lines, and inline marks. A
 * `$default` method is found and resolved regardless of [methodFilter], since it is synthetic and
 * so never accepted by the filter the method and branch tiers share.
 *
 * This is read-only. It only sizes the probe array and builds manifest metadata, ahead of the
 * actual rewrite that [BranchProbeAsmVisitorWrapper] performs later in the same class transform.
 *
 * A switch's outcome count is one per case entry plus the default. A `TABLESWITCH` over sparse
 * case values carries filler entries for the gaps that jump straight to the default label; those
 * are the default outcome, not cases of their own, and counting them separately would report
 * "case 4 never hit" for a switch that has no case 4. [BranchProbeMethodVisitor] applies the same
 * rule when it rewrites the switch, so the two agree on the slot count.

    /**
     * Resolves every [eligibleMethodKeys] method's raw candidates (collected by [analyze]) into
     * its final [CallEdge] list.
     *
     * A same-class candidate is a pass-through only when this class declares it with a body and
     * it is not in [eligibleMethodKeys]: its own raw candidates are substituted in its place,
     * transitively, guarded by a per-entry-point visited set so a cycle among pass-through methods
     * terminates instead of looping. An abstract or native method has no body to pass through, and
     * a method this class only inherits (javac names the receiver's static type as owner, so
     * `this.inherited()` arrives with this class as owner) is not in the method table at all; both
     * stay verbatim edges, since the abstract case is exactly the template-method edge a collector
     * widens to the implementers.
     *
     * A cross-class candidate shaped like a Kotlin `$default` method is resolved against the target
     * class's own bytecode fetched through [lookup], the same mechanism [resolveScalaGetterSites]
     * uses for a Scala constructor getter's cross-class target; a `$default` whose target
     * the descriptor cannot name falls through to the general rule below, since its body invokes
     * the target anyway. A default-shaped constructor that is kotlinc's accessor for a private
     * constructor ([isConstructorAccessor]) is never resolved that way: it is synthetic and never
     * probed, so it passes through to the constructor it forwards to, although the general rule
     * keeps every other constructor as an edge. Any cross-class candidate whose owner declares it
     * with a body the method tier would not probe (a bridge, an `access$` accessor, any other
     * synthetic method that is not a probed lambda body, a Hibernate enhancement method, or a
     * suspend lambda's `create` or `invoke`, see [wouldNotBeProbedByMethodTier]) is a pass-through
     * the same way: its own raw candidates, read from the owner's bytes via [readMethodTable], are
     * substituted transitively. Invoking a cross-class pass-through is itself a use of its owner,
     * so it also adds an edge to that owner's `<clinit>`, the same as a static field read or write
     * on that owner (see [CallCandidateMethodVisitor]); this edge is never gated on the owner
     * actually declaring a `<clinit>`, since the collector drops an edge with no matching node. A
     * cross-class candidate that owner's bytes cannot resolve, or that the owner does not declare
     * at all (an inherited method), stays a verbatim edge with its original virtual flag;
     * one the owner declares and the method tier would probe keeps its name and descriptor but has
     * its virtual flag corrected the same way a same-class target's is.
     *
     * A candidate named `<init>` or `<clinit>` whose owner's [MethodTable.hasEnclosingMethod] is
     * true names a body class: a suspend lambda, an object expression, or an anonymous or local
     * class. A function or property reference is a body class too, but a synthetic one, handled
     * below. Besides the edge for that candidate, an edge is added from the entry point to every
     * method the body class declares with a body, other than `<init>` and `<clinit>`, that the
     * method tier would probe, with the same non-virtual correction a same-class target gets. The
     * creator is the only method that can ever reach a body class's methods, so without this edge
     * every one of them would look uncalled the moment its only caller is out of scope, which is
     * the common case: a framework invokes an object expression's `run`, or a coroutine library
     * resumes a suspend lambda. A named, non-local class carries no `EnclosingMethod` attribute,
     * so `new` on one is never expanded this way.
     *
     * A body class the agent never probes ([MethodTable.isUnprobedBodyClass]) is a pass-through as
     * a whole, since an edge into it would name a method with no probe. kotlinc makes such classes
     * for every function and property reference and each `$sam$` wrapper, which are synthetic, and
     * for every suspend function's own continuation. A candidate for any of its methods adds no
     * edge to the class itself. Its own raw candidates are substituted in its place instead. When
     * the candidate is its `<init>` or `<clinit>`, the raw candidates of every other method it
     * declares with a body are substituted too, as `CREATES` edges, the way the body-class edges
     * above are. So `val f = ::twice` gives its creator a `CREATES` edge to `twice`, the same edge
     * a Java `this::twice` gives. A continuation's `invokeSuspend` calls back into the suspend
     * function that created it, which is a self-edge and is dropped.
     *
     * Self-edges (the entry-point method calling itself, directly or through a pass-through
     * chain) are dropped, and so is a candidate for this class's own `<clinit>`, which a
     * substituted forwarder on another class can carry back in when it reads a static field of
     * the class being analysed: a method of this class that runs has already initialised it.
     *
     * Every edge has a kind. A candidate starts with its own: [CallEdgeKind.CREATES] for a
     * `LambdaMetafactory` `invokedynamic`, [CallEdgeKind.CALL] for everything else. The edges that
     * take a pass-through's place keep the kind of the candidate that reached it, and a `CREATES`
     * candidate found inside the pass-through stays `CREATES`. So once a walk passes a `CREATES`
     * step, every edge below it is `CREATES`: such an edge only runs once the created body runs,
     * never when the creator runs. The captured count travels with the kind, capped at the
     * substituted target's own parameter count. The only pass-through a compiler names as an
     * implementation is scalac's boxing forwarder, which passes its parameters on in order. The
     * body-class edges are `CREATES` edges with nothing captured, while the constructor or
     * initializer edge that leads to them keeps the kind it arrived with. Edges are deduplicated
     * per entry point by every field, kind and captured count included, so a method that both
     * calls and creates the same target keeps both edges.
     *
     * The implemented interface travels with the kind the same way the captured count does. A
     * `LambdaMetafactory` candidate brings its [RawCandidate.functionalInterface], and every edge
     * that takes its kind from that candidate keeps it. A body-class edge has none. It is part of
     * the visited key and of the edge, so one body created for two interfaces gives two edges.
     *
     * References ride the same walk, unfiltered: an entry point starts with its own, and every
     * pass-through substituted into it, same-class or cross-class, adds its own, so a reference is
     * attributed exactly where the pass-through's callees are. A cross-class `$default` resolved to
     * its target also adds its own references, since its body evaluates the default expressions on
     * the caller's behalf. A body-class join adds none: the body class's methods hold their own
     * references in their own class's analysis. A body class the agent never probes has no
     * analysis of its own, so each of its methods the walk passes through adds its references like
     * any other pass-through.
     *
     * With [handlerInterfaces] given, the same walk also finds the forwarder table's entries. See
     * [findHandlerForwarders].
     *
     * Each edge carries the guard of the entry point's instruction that recorded its candidate,
     * from [guardsByMethod]. For an `<init>` call on a body class, that instruction is
     * the `new` the call completes. [isOwnClassBodyClass] says whether this class is a body class
     * itself. Every edge the walk finds below a candidate keeps that candidate's guard, so an edge
     * that takes a pass-through's place keeps the guard of the call to the pass-through. The guard
     * is part of the visited key and of the edge, so a callee reached under two guards gives two
     * edges. The forwarder table's walk sets no guard, since its candidates are not an entry
     * point's own.
     *
     * A generated forwarder ([PASS_THROUGH_FORWARDERS]: a `JVM_OVERLOADS` overload, a
     * `MULTIFILE_FACADE` function, a `DEFAULT_IMPLS` method or a Scala `STATIC_FORWARDER`) is a
     * pass-through too, though it keeps its probe. [forwarderKeys] names this class's own, and
     * [MethodTable.forwarderKeys] another class's. A call into one records edges to what the
     * forwarder calls, transitively, and a cross-class one implies its owner's `<clinit>`, the same
     * as any other cross-class pass-through. So a call to a `@JvmOverloads` overload reaches the
     * full function through its `$default` twin, a call to a multi-file facade reaches the part's
     * function, and a call to a Scala static forwarder reaches the object's method. A `<init>`
     * forwarder of a body class still adds the body-class edges. The forwarder keeps its own
     * references, since it has a probe to hold them, so none of them are added to the caller. An
     * entry point that is itself a generated forwarder does not pass through other forwarders:
     * its own edges name its callees as its bytecode does. A `$default` whose target is a
     * forwarder, as a multi-file facade's may be, passes through the target too.
     *
     * A virtual call into a forwarder, or into another class's bridge, that a subclass can
     * override, one neither private, static nor final in a class that is not final ([classAccess]
     * for this class's own), also keeps its edge to the method called. Other pass-throughs, such as
     * an accessor or an enhancement method (ADR 0047), never stand for an override. The pass-through names what
     * that method runs, and the edge lets a collector walk down to every override: an `open`
     * class's stub for an interface default, a bridge from kotlinc 2.2 and a marked method before
     * it, passes through to the interface's code, while a subclass that overrides it is reached
     * only through the virtual edge. The same holds for a call to this class's own bridge.
     *
     * A call naming a class that only inherits the method (`plain.p()` where `Plain` extends the
     * `open class Open` that declares the stub) is resolved at the first superclass up from it that
     * declares the method, from [superInternalName] for this class's own calls; the walk stops at a
     * superclass out of scope or unreadable, and after [MAX_INHERITED_DECLARATION_HOPS]. When that
     * declaration is a forwarder or a bridge, its callees are passed through as for a direct call.
     * This matters for the `-jvm-default=disable` stub, whose code is in `$DefaultImpls`, which is no
     * supertype a collector walks up through; from kotlinc 2.2 the walk up already reaches the
     * interface's own method. Only forwarders and bridges are looked for: kotlinc names the declaring
     * class for a `$default` or an `access$` call. The edge naming the class called keeps its place,
     * so a collector can walk down to an override below it.
     *
     * Under `-jvm-default=disable` a virtual call naming the interface itself (`describer.plain()`
     * with `describer: Describer`) names an abstract method, and the code it may run is the static
     * method of that name in `<interface>$DefaultImpls`. Each implementing class reaches it through
     * a marked stub, which is no node, so the call also gets an edge to that `$DefaultImpls` method.

     * What compiled each of [internalClassName]'s own declared methods into existence, from
     * bytecode shape alone. The only annotation any rule reads is `kotlin.Metadata`: its kind for the
     * multi-file facade rule, and its presence for the `-jvm-default=disable` stub rule below.
     *
     * A class named with the `$DefaultImpls` suffix marks a method [GeneratedBy.DEFAULT_IMPLS] only
     * when its body only forwards, as [defaultImplsForwarders] checks, and marks nothing else in the
     * class. Under `-jvm-default=enable`, the default from language version 2.2, the interface
     * method holds the real body and `$DefaultImpls` keeps a forwarder for callers compiled against
     * the older layout, which nothing in the application calls and which would otherwise read as
     * never hit. Under `-jvm-default=disable`, the default up to language version 2.1, the
     * interface method is abstract and `$DefaultImpls` holds the real body, conditionals included,
     * so marking every method in the class would hide code the adopter wrote. The forwarder test
     * reads the body, never the `Deprecated` attribute kotlinc gives a forwarder, since an
     * adopter's own `@Deprecated` default method carries that attribute too.
     *
     * A class whose direct superclass is `java.lang.Enum` marks `values()` returning an array of
     * the class, `valueOf(Ljava/lang/String;)` returning the class, and `getEntries()` of any
     * descriptor, [GeneratedBy.ENUM].
     *
     * A class whose direct superclass is `java.lang.Record` marks `equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`,
     * `hashCode()I`, and `toString()Ljava/lang/String;` [GeneratedBy.RECORD] only when the body is
     * javac's, as [javacRecordMembers] reads it. A method the adopter wrote stays
     * [GeneratedBy.NONE], and so do the record's accessors, which are the adopter's own component
     * declarations.
     *
     * In a class that carries `kotlin.Metadata` and implements an interface, a method that only
     * forwards to that interface's `$DefaultImpls` is [GeneratedBy.DEFAULT_IMPLS]; see
     * [defaultImplsStubs].
     *
     * A data class is recognised by the shape the compiler alone can produce: a consecutive
     * `component1` through `componentN`, each taking no parameters, whose return types in order
     * equal the parameter types of some `<init>` with exactly N parameters, plus a `copy` taking
     * those same N parameter types and returning the class itself, plus
     * `equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`, `hashCode()I`, and `toString()Ljava/lang/String;`. Nothing is
     * marked unless all of them are present; a class that hand-writes some but not all, such as a
     * bare `copy` and `component1` with no `equals`, `hashCode`, or `toString`, is left
     * [GeneratedBy.NONE] throughout, since the compiler itself never produces that partial shape.
     * Once the shape matches, `componentN` and `copy` are [GeneratedBy.DATA_CLASS], and each of
     * `equals`, `hashCode` and `toString` is [GeneratedBy.DATA_CLASS] only when it is absent from
     * [methodsWithLineNumbers]; see [markDataClassMembers].
     *
     * A constructor or method that only forwards to its own class's `$default` twin, the way an
     * overload `@JvmOverloads` adds does, is [GeneratedBy.JVM_OVERLOADS]; see
     * [jvmOverloadsForwarders]. The body is read only when the class declares a
     * `$default` method or constructor at all, since a forwarder needs one to call.
     *
     * In a class whose [kotlinKind] is [KotlinKind.MULTIFILE_CLASS_FACADE], a function that only
     * forwards to the same function on a part is [GeneratedBy.MULTIFILE_FACADE]; see
     * [multifileFacadeForwarders]. Any other method of the facade with a body of its own, apart
     * from the constructor and the type initializer, is [UnreadShape.MULTIFILE_FACADE], since a
     * facade holds no adopter code.
     *
     * In a class that [isScalaClass], a static forwarder, a case class's and its companion's
     * plumbing and an object's `writeReplace` are marked as [ScalaGeneratedMethods] reads them,
     * with [lookup] reading a companion's partner class. They go in after every rule
     * above, each only where no earlier rule marked the method, the way the `@JvmOverloads` and
     * multi-file facade marks do. No compiler emits a shape both a Kotlin rule and a Scala rule
     * match, so the order only settles which rule is authoritative if one ever did: the older one.

     *    `invokestatic` of `Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter` or `checkParameterIsNotNull`.
     * 2. It pushes the twin's arguments. That is `this` for a constructor or an instance method.
     *    Then, for each of the full parameter list's values, either its own next parameter or the
     *    zero value of that type (`aconst_null`, `iconst_0`, `lconst_0`, `fconst_0`, `dconst_0`).
     *    Its own parameters are each loaded once, in order, and have the same types as the values
     *    they fill. Then one `int` constant per mask word, with exactly the omitted values' bits
     *    set. Then `aconst_null` for the trailing marker.
     * 3. It calls the twin. For a constructor, that is `invokespecial` of an `<init>` in the same
     *    class whose descriptor ends in `DefaultConstructorMarker;)V`. For a method, it is
     *    `invokestatic` of `name$default` in the same class, under the forwarder's own name. For an
     *    instance method, the twin's first parameter is the class itself.
     * 4. It returns, with one xRETURN.
     *
     * At least one value must be omitted, so the source's full constructor or function, which
     * holds the real body, never matches. Nor does a secondary constructor that passes every
     * argument to the full `<init>`, or a method under another name that calls a `$default` twin.
     * Any other instruction means the body is not a forwarder. The rule is narrow on purpose, for
     * the reason [defaultImplsForwarders] gives. kotlinc 2.2.21 emits this shape for a constructor,
     * an instance method and a top-level function (checked with `javap`). It never reads the
     * annotation, which sits on the full declaration and not on the overloads.
     *
     * The source can write the same bytecode by hand. A secondary constructor or a same-named
     * overload that calls the full one with named arguments and leaves some out, such as
     * `constructor(a: Int, r: Int) : this(amount = a, rounding = r)`, compiles to this shape and
     * is marked too (checked with `javap`). Without named arguments, such a call resolves to the

     * parameter's type, then makes exactly one `invokestatic` whose owner is the interface, then
     * returns with one xRETURN. kotlinc's parameter null checks may come before the loads, as in
     * [multifileFacadeForwarders]: a forwarder with a non-null reference parameter starts with
     * `aload; ldc "<name>"; invokestatic Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter`. Where a sub-interface
     * fixes a type argument at a primitive, the call returns the primitive and the forwarder boxes
     * it with its box type's `valueOf` for its own return (kotlinc 2.2.21 to 2.4.20, and earlier
     * under `all-compatibility`). Labels, line numbers, frames and other pseudo-instructions are
     * ignored; any other instruction, a `checkcast` included, means the method is not a forwarder
     * to the interface.
     *
     * Under `-jvm-default=disable`, the default up to kotlinc 2.1 and an explicit choice after, a
     * sub-interface that inherits a default gets a `$DefaultImpls` method forwarding to the
     * super-interface's instead: `SubDescriber$DefaultImpls.plain(LSubDescriber;)` loads its
     * receiver, casts it to `Describer`, and calls `Describer$DefaultImpls.plain(LDescriber;)` with
     * the same name (checked with `javap` on kotlinc 1.9.25 and 2.1.21). That call may pass the
     * parameters as an erased generic signature would, as [forwardsThroughErasure] checks, since a
     * sub-interface can fix a type argument, and a suspend default boxes a primitive argument with
     * `Boxing.box<Type>`. `override fun plain() = super<Describer>.plain()` in a sub-interface
     * compiles to the same call with no cast; it is marked too, as ADR 0026's amendment explains for
     * implementing classes.
     *
     * The rule is kept this narrow on purpose. A real forwarder shape it misses shows up as a
     * false never-hit, which someone can see and report; a wider rule that also matched a real body
     * would hide that body from never-hit with nothing to show for it. Every forwarder in the
     * compiler matrix's fixtures matches, generic, primitive, `long`/`double`, property accessor,
     * `$default` and suspend methods included (ADR 0055).

     * parameter in order, makes one `invokestatic` of the stub's own name on `<interface>$DefaultImpls`,
     * and returns with one xRETURN. No null check comes first (checked with `javap` on kotlinc
     * 1.9.25 and 2.1.21 for a non-null `String` parameter). Only a method that is not static,
     * synthetic, a bridge or bodyless is checked; from kotlinc 2.2 the stub is a bridge and the
     * method tier leaves it out.
     *
     * The called descriptor is the stub's own with the interface type prepended, except where the
     * class implements a generic interface: `Impl : I<String>` gets `put(Ljava/lang/String;)` calling
     * `put(LI;Ljava/lang/Object;)`, and `get()Ljava/lang/String;` calling `get(LI;)Ljava/lang/Object;`
     * then `checkcast java/lang/String` (checked with `javap` on kotlinc 2.1.21). So a parameter or a
     * return type may differ when both are references, and a differing return needs exactly that
     * cast. At a primitive type argument (`Impl : I<Int>`) the stub boxes the parameter with its box
     * type's `valueOf` before the call, and returns the box type through the same cast; any other
     * primitive must match exactly.
     *
     * The interface is one the class file lists itself. kotlinc names the direct interface's
     * `$DefaultImpls`, even for a default declared on a super-interface (checked with `javap`), so no
     * supertype is walked. The caller checks `kotlin.Metadata`, since Java source can write this body
     * by hand and Kotlin source cannot reach a `$DefaultImpls` class.
