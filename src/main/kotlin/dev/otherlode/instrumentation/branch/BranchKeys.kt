 * Derives the branch key of each kept branch outcome, and the site key of each kept site, from the

 *
 * [compute] returns a key for every kept outcome it can name safely, keyed by
 * `(siteIndex, outcome offset)`. An outcome missing from the result has no key: the agent could
 * not name it safely, and a collector treats it as an outcome it has never seen.
 *
 * [computeSiteKeys] returns a key for every kept site, keyed by `siteIndex`. It uses the same rules,
 * so a site has a key exactly when at least one of its outcomes has one. A site key digests the same input as a
 * branch key without the outcome token, under its own derivation tag, so it never equals a branch
 * key.
 *
 * Two tracked sites in one method collide when they share a [BranchSite.conditionFingerprint] and
 * [BranchSite.inlinedFromClassName]. Dropped sites count toward a collision, since whether a kept
 * site gets a key must depend on the method's bytecode alone, not on scope configuration. A site
 * with a null fingerprint never gets a key and never takes part in a collision group, so it costs
 * no other site its key.
