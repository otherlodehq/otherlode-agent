/**
 * Sends every payload shape to a collector at [endpoint] over plain HTTP/1.1.
 * This uses the JDK's built-in [HttpClient]. It avoids a shaded gRPC/Netty
 * dependency.
 *
 * Each send retries up to [maxAttempts] times, with capped exponential
 * backoff, but only for failures that a retry can plausibly fix: a
 * connection or timeout error, a 5xx, a 408, or a 429. Any other 4xx fails
 * at once. The collector has already read the bytes and rejected them, so
 * resending the same bytes a moment later cannot change its answer; it only
 * burns the flush budget. If every attempt fails, the exception propagates
 * to the caller. The caller is expected to be [ExportScheduler]. It treats
 * the exception as a signal to leave the registry baseline untouched, and
 * retries the whole delta on the next flush.
 *
 * The client is built on the first send, on whichever thread sends, not when the exporter is
 * constructed: building a JDK [HttpClient] initialises the default `SSLContext` even for an `http`
 * URL, which is a cost the `premain` thread should not pay. Exporters given the same [lazyClient]
 * share one client. The client's connect timeout and each request's [requestTimeout] are both
 * bounded by default. Without a timeout, a collector that accepts a
 * connection but never responds would block a send indefinitely. This can
 * happen if the collector is wedged, or if the network silently drops
 * packets. An indefinite block would stall the [ExportScheduler] send it
 * runs on, and the flush waiting for it, liveness heartbeat included,
 * instead of failing into the retry/backoff path above.
 *
 * The collector may require a bearer token, passed as [authToken]. A 401 or 403 is a permanent
 * failure like any other 4xx: resending with the same token cannot change the answer.
