     * One flush attempt. Sends whatever manifest entries haven't gone out
     * yet, and the delta since the last acknowledged baseline.
     *
     * The delta batch is sent even when empty. A collector otherwise has no
     * way to tell an instance that's alive but idle from one that's crashed
     * or lost its network path. An empty batch acts as a liveness heartbeat.
     *
     * Neither send has an explicit retry queue. A failure just leaves the
     * relevant state where it is, so the next tick retries it naturally.
     * [dev.otherlode.export.HttpOtlpStyleExporter] still wraps
     * each individual send in its own capped exponential backoff, for a
     * transient failure within one attempt.
     *
     * The two main sends run concurrently, not one after the other. Each can take
     * a while to fail on its own (multiple retries, each with its own
     * timeout) if the collector is unreachable. Run back to back, a single
     * flush's worst case could take roughly twice one flush interval,
     * meaning the liveness heartbeat above would arrive far less often than
     * configured during exactly the outage it exists to report. Running
     * them side by side keeps one flush's worst case close to a single
     * send's worst case instead of the sum of both.
     *
     * Up to two more manifest sends follow on this thread, once both main sends have ended. A
     * second manifest send runs only when this flush's confirmed delta sends released a dependency
     * that no manifest has carried yet. It carries that dependency and the mappings
     * held on it, so they go out in the same flush as their counts. Then an empty manifest carries
     * `dependenciesListed`, when the flag is due, no confirmed manifest has carried it, and every
     * send of this flush was confirmed. Neither extra send runs during an outage, so a flush's worst
     * case stays that of one send.
     *
     * This method runs under `scheduleAtFixedRate`, which stops calling a
     * task forever the first time it lets a throwable escape, with nothing
     * logged. So `sendManifestDelta` and `sendDeltaBatch` each wrap their
     * own registry call (`compute*`) and exporter call in one catch of
     * `Throwable`, not `Exception`: a `NoClassDefFoundError` from a class
     * first touched on the export path is as fatal to the schedule as any
     * exception, and would otherwise stop every future flush, heartbeat
     * included. The outer catch here covers what the sends cannot, such as
     * a rejected submission after [stop].
     *
     * [final] is true only for the flush [flushOnShutdown] runs. It is carried onto every delta
     * batch this flush sends, the empty heartbeat and a standalone batch of endpoint or dependency
     * deltas included, so a collector can tell an instance that ended cleanly from one that went
     * silent. The manifest send is unaffected.
