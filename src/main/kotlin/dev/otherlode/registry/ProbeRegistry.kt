/**
 * Stores one probe-count array per class. Each array is a plain `long[]`,
 * keyed by (class name, probe-layout hash, defining classloader). A probe
 * hit does one direct `arr[index]++`, with no shared map and no atomic
 * operations on the hot path.
 *
 * Counts are approximate under concurrency, and deliberately so. A thread
 * preempted between the load and the store writes back its own stale value
 * plus one, so any number of increments can be lost and a later read can
 * see the count *fall*. What no race can do is put it back to zero: the
 * lowest value any increment ever stores is one, written by a thread that
 * read zero. A probe that ran at least once therefore stays at one or
 * more, and the collector's "never hit" claim, which asks only whether the
 * count is zero, survives what the exact count does not. That is why an
 * unsynchronised array is enough here.
 *
 * Two caveats, neither of which the JVM memory model rules out. It permits
 * a non-volatile `long` to be written and read in two halves (JLS 17.7),
 * and a torn read can then combine an old half with a new one: a count
 * crossing `0xFFFF_FFFF` could read as zero. It also permits a JIT to keep
 * a plain array increment in a register across a loop and store once on
 * exit, so a probe in a loop that never exits could read zero while it
 * runs. Neither happens on 64-bit HotSpot, which makes aligned `long`
 * accesses atomic and does not sink these stores; the guarantee rests on
 * that, not on the specification. There is also no happens-before edge
 * between a hit and the export thread's read, so nothing orders them; a
 * flush is many milliseconds later and reads the write in practice.
 *
 * This type only manages bookkeeping for those arrays: allocation,
 * baseline/delta accounting, and manifest metadata. Instrumented bytecode
 * receives the array at class-init, and writes to it directly from there.
 *
 * The key includes the probe-layout hash, not just the class name. This
 * matters for a class reloaded by the *same* classloader identity with an
 * unchanged layout, which static attach never produces but which is cheap
 * to keep correct. If the layout is unchanged, the class keeps its existing
 * array and history. If the layout changed, old counts would not mean
 * anything against the new bytecode, so the class gets a fresh array
 * instead of a merge.
 *
 * The key also includes the defining classloader's identity, not just the
 * class name. JVM class identity is (classloader, name), not name alone: two
 * different, concurrently active classloaders can define a class with the
 * same fully-qualified name (multi-tenant app servers, OSGi, plugin hosts),
 * and those are two unrelated classes that happen to share a name, not one
 * class reloaded. Keying on name alone would silently merge their hit
 * counts into one manifest entry. Identity is tracked via
 * [System.identityHashCode] rather than holding the [ClassLoader] itself, so
 * a retired classloader (for example, a devtools-style same-JVM reload that
 * swaps in a new classloader for changed classes) can still be garbage
 * collected instead of being pinned forever by this registry.
 *
 * This registry does not, on its own, give a class continuity across an
 * actual app/JVM restart: a fresh [ProbeRegistry] is created every time
 * [dev.otherlode.Agent.premain] runs, so restarting the process
 * always starts every count at zero regardless of this key. Long-running,
 * cross-restart visibility is the collector's job: it aggregates deltas
 * from every `service.instance.id` a service has ever reported, over time.
 *
 * A class's manifest is send-once. When [advanceManifestBaseline] records it as delivered, the
 * class's probe locations and its other manifest-only fields are released, and only each probe's
 * kind stays, for the delta path. A delivered class's locations cannot be sent again.
 *
 * @property confirmsDefinitions Switches the whole confirmation mechanism on: [computeManifestDeltas]
 * and [manifest] withhold a class's probe locations and its [ClassLocation] and [ClassReferences] records until the
 * class is confirmed defined, by a probe count above zero or a name [confirmFrom] is told the JVM
 * has loaded, and [confirmFrom] itself does the tracking. False leaves all of it inert, so a
 * caller that wires a sweep to a registry that does not withhold cannot be told a class's probes
 * were withheld when they were published. Internal wiring, not an adopter-facing option.
