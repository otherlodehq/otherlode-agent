/**
 * Tracks the dependencies this instance has seen, one record per identity key, and delivers each
 * record to the collector once.
 *
 * A dependency's identity key is the sorted list of its `group:artifact` pairs ([identityKey]),
 * never its version, so two jars carrying the same libraries at different versions are one
 * dependency. Ids are per instance, assigned in registration order from 0, like
 * [EndpointRegistry]'s endpoint ids.
 *
 * Manifest delivery follows [EndpointRegistry]'s snapshot pattern: [computeManifestEntries] stages
 * records onto the snapshot it returns, and [advanceManifest] marks exactly those delivered once
 * the send carrying them is confirmed. A record never changes after registration, so unlike an
 * endpoint it needs no version, only a delivered flag.
 *
 * Each record also holds the distinct class names the sweep has matched to it ([recordLoaded]).
 * Their count goes out as a cumulative total through [computeDeltas] and [advanceDeltas], the same
 * snapshot pattern, whenever it differs from the last total delivered.
 *
 * Constructed with `indexClassNames`, the registry also keeps a class index: every class name of
 * every dependency the startup listing registers, mapped to that dependency's id, the first
 * registration of a name winning as the classpath search order would. The static baseline maps its
 * references through it ([dependencyForClass]), since it has no defining loader to ask. Without the
 * flag no index is kept: it costs memory in proportion to the dependencies' class count. For the
 * same reason the baseline releases it ([releaseClassIndex]) once it has been read.
 *
 * A record is held back from the manifest until its loaded-class count has reached the collector,
 * so a collector never reads a used jar as unloaded. Each counting sweep ends with [markCounted],
 * which opens a counting generation. A record takes the first generation that finds it
 * registered. Once every delta send computed after that sweep is confirmed, the export thread calls
 * [markCountsDelivered] with it. [computeManifestEntries] offers only records whose generation has
 * been delivered this way ([isSendable]).
 *
 * A record's location is for display, and a jar under the user's home folder, such as one in
 * `~/.m2`, would put the user's name on the wire. So [register] stores it with the home folder
 * written as `~` ([withHomeAsTilde]), and [homeDirectory] is `user.home` unless a test sets it.
 *
 * Safe to use from several threads: the listing registers, the sweep records loads and
 * registers jars found at load on the scheduler thread, and the send pool computes and advances.
