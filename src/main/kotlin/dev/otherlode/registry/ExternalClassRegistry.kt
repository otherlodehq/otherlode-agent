/**
 * The out-of-scope classes the adopter's code references, each with where the transform found it,
 * resolved to a dependency and delivered once per name.
 *
 * [record] runs on transforming threads and only remembers a location string. Resolution waits for
 * the export thread, since it can read a jar, and for [isListingComplete], since before the startup
 * listing has finished a jar on the classpath would be registered as discovered by load. A name
 * whose location [resolveLocation] maps to no dependency (a jar of the adopter's own, an agent jar,
 * an unsupported scheme) is resolved once and never sent. A name no loader could find is sent as
 * absent.
 *
 * The static baseline records names it has already mapped through [recordResolved]; they go out on
 * the manifest the same way, so the baseline itself never carries a mapping and no name is sent
 * twice.
 *
 * A name that maps to a dependency is held while [isDependencySendable] is false for that id. It is
 * neither delivered nor dropped, and a later compute offers it. An absent name names no dependency
 * and is never held.
 *
 * Delivery follows [DependencyRegistry]'s snapshot pattern: [computeManifestEntries] stages entries
 * onto the snapshot it returns, and [advanceManifest] marks exactly those delivered once the send
 * carrying them is confirmed.
