/**
 * Tracks one probe per HTTP endpoint, counted at the point a framework matches a request to it,
 * before the handler runs. Endpoints need their own probe because a method probe alone cannot say
 * "GET /promo was never served", since a handler can back two endpoints, be a lambda the framework
 * invokes through a hidden class, or live outside `includePackages`.
 *
 * Identity is `(verb, normalised route template)`, computed by [RouteTemplateNormalizer]. Two
 * registrations that normalise to the same identity, even from different framework objects, are
 * one endpoint with one [EndpointEntry.endpointId] and one count.
 *
 * A framework module also supplies one or more dispatch keys that identify the framework's own
 * route (a Ktor route node, a JDK `HttpContext`, a list of a Spring pattern and verb). [lookup]
 * resolves a key to its entry on the request path, so normalisation runs once per endpoint rather
 * than once per request. A key made of values (a string, or a list of strings) is compared by
 * `equals`. Any other key object is a framework's own route object: it is compared by identity
 * and held weakly, so a routing tree a test or a devtools restart throws away is not kept alive
 * by its bindings. A list holding one such object beside values (Spring's functional key) is
 * held weakly on that object and compared by value otherwise. A key whose object was collected
 * is unbound; its endpoint stays.
 *
 * Follows the same snapshot pattern as [ProbeRegistry]: [computeDeltas]/[advanceDeltas] and
 * [computeManifestEntries]/[advanceManifest] stage state onto the returned snapshot rather than
 * directly onto the registry, so two sends in flight at once (a scheduled flush and a shutdown
 * flush) cannot mark each other's unconfirmed work as delivered.
 *
 * Unlike a class's probe locations, which are sent once and never again, an endpoint record can
 * change after it is first delivered (its discovery source upgrades, or a handler join is
 * learned later). Each entry therefore carries a version bumped on every such change; a manifest
 * snapshot remembers the version it staged per entry, and [advanceManifest] only ever raises
 * `deliveredVersion`, never lowers it. A change landing while a send is in flight is still picked
 * up by the next compute, since the version it bumped to was never staged by that in-flight send.
