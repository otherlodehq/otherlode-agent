/**
 * The rules for whether a jar is a dependency, shared by the startup listing and by the sweep
 * when it meets a jar the listing never saw.
 *
 * A jar on its own (one the system loader reads, or one the sweep meets through a `file:` URL) is
 * never a dependency when its manifest names an agent or marks it as a Spring Boot fat jar or
 * executable war ([kindOf]). A jar stored inside a fat jar, or one an exploded Spring Boot
 * application's own loader reads, is judged by the adopter's-own rule alone. The agent
 * rule exists because a `-javaagent` jar sits on the classpath; a jar under `BOOT-INF/lib` that
 * carries `Premain-Class`, such as `byte-buddy-agent`, is a library the application calls, not a
 * running agent, so it stays a dependency.
 *
 * A jar holding a class in the agent's own package ([TypeMatchPolicy.AGENT_PACKAGE_PREFIX]) is
 * never a dependency either, flat or nested. The agent-jar rule reads the manifest, and an unshaded
 * build of the agent carries no `Premain-Class`. This rule keeps such a build off the list when it
 * sits on a classpath beside the shaded agent jar.
 *
 * A jar holding any class [TypeMatchPolicy.isIncluded] admits is the adopter's own.
