/**
 * Two endpoints and one feature-flagged class, illustrating three things static analysis can't
 * catch.
 *
 * `/checkout`'s free-shipping branch is only ever exercised one way, given how
 * [com.example.demo.client] calls it. `/promo` is reachable, but never called at all -
 * both are method-level "loaded but never hit" findings. [LegacyDiscountCalculator] is a level
 * further: its feature flag is always off in this demo, so the class itself never loads, which
 * only the static baseline (opted into below via `staticBaselineEnabled=true`) can report.
 * [formatTotal]'s two optional parameters add a fourth: [handleCheckout] always supplies
 * `decimals` and never supplies `currency`, giving the omission tier one finding of each kind.
 *
 * [PromoHandler.handle] also demonstrates an unreached cluster: it alone calls [applyPromoCode],
 * which alone calls [PromoRepository.find], so a client that never calls `/promo` leaves all three
 * methods, and `PromoRepository` itself, unreached together. [handleCheckout] demonstrates the
 * same call-edge attribution for a class that never loads at all: it calls
 * [LegacyDiscountCalculator]'s constructor and `apply`, and reads a static field of [LegacyRates],
 * both under the branch this demo never takes; the constructor and the field read are two
 * different ways an unloaded class is reached from [handleCheckout]. [handleCheckout] also holds
 * [respond] as a function-typed value and calls it through that value: kotlinc compiles the
 * reference to its own class, a body class, whose `invoke` only the reference's holder ever
 * calls. Calling it on every request keeps that `invoke` and [respond] itself out of
 * every unreached cluster, which proves the body-class edge rather than manufacturing a finding.
 *
 * The two handlers are registered in deliberately different shapes. `/checkout` takes a function
 * reference, which Kotlin converts to the Java [HttpHandler] interface through `invokedynamic`:
 * the handler is a hidden class with no stable name, so the endpoint carries no handler join and
 * the collector learns which method backs it only from the call graph. `/promo` takes
 * [PromoHandler], a named class, so its endpoint record names `PromoHandler.handle` and the
 * collector can put the route beside that method's never-hit row and its unreached cluster's root.
 *
 * Four more shapes cover the class findings otherlode-server reports. [main] names [AuditLog]
 * and [ReceiptPrinter] through class literals, which load a class without initialising it:
 * `AuditLog` is loaded and never initialised, and `ReceiptPrinter`, which has no static
 * initialiser, is loaded and never instantiated. [handleCheckout] builds every [Money] from pence,
 * leaving its pounds-and-pence constructor an unused overload, and always passes [Price]'s scale,
 * so the overload `@JvmOverloads` adds never runs and is never reported.
 *
 * [checkoutGreeting] and [farewellNote] sit in two files that `@file:JvmMultifileClass` joins into
 * one facade, `DemoText`, which holds only generated forwarders. [handleCheckout] calls the first,
 * and nothing calls the second, so its part never loads. Both parts read by their file names.
