// HttpServerAttributesExtractor.onEnd and internal.HttpRouteState at the names this module's
// advice is written against (see OnEndAdvice's own KDoc for what was verified and how). Compiling
// against the floor version, never a newer one, is this project's no-muzzle policy: a module
// disables itself once on a LinkageError against a version its advice does not match, rather than
// pinning to whatever is newest today.

// class itself touches.
// The weekly framework canary sets both to the newest release of their lines.
