/**
 * Endpoint module for JAX-RS, covering both the `javax.ws.rs` and `jakarta.ws.rs` namespaces with
 * one module and no compile-time dependency on either.
 *
 * JAX-RS has no registration hook comparable to Spring's handler-method mapping or Ktor's
 * `handle`: a resource class declares its routes purely through annotations, read once by the
 * framework's own runtime when it builds its route table. There is nothing to advise for
 * "declaration", so this module reads the annotations itself, directly from the [TypeDescription]
 * ByteBuddy hands to [transform], and calls the endpoint seam from this ordinary Kotlin code
 * rather than from woven advice. That is safe here specifically because this code runs inside the
 * agent's own JVM context, never inlined into the resource class's bytecode: the Kotlin-intrinsics
 * hazard that keeps [dev.otherlode.endpoints.jaxrs.ResourceMethodAdvice] a Java class
 * does not apply to a class that is only ever loaded on the agent's own classloader.
 *
 * Method-level annotations are inherited by the specification's own rule: a method the concrete
 * class declares with no JAX-RS annotation of its own inherits the annotations of the method it
 * overrides or implements. Class-level `@Path` is not inherited per the specification, but Jersey
 * honours one declared on a superclass or interface, so this module does too, only when Jersey is
 * present on the resource class's own loader. See [resolveAnnotationSource] and
 * [resolveClassPath].
 *
 * [jerseyPresent] answers whether Jersey is on a resource class's own loader; the default reads a
 * marker resource off that loader without loading any class. A test supplies its own function to
 * force either branch without adding a second JAX-RS runtime to the build. The constructor is
 * `@JvmOverloads` so [java.util.ServiceLoader], which needs a genuine no-argument constructor at
 * the bytecode level, can still instantiate this class.
