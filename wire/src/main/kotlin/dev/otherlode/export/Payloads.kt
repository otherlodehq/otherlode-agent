 * default) only when [overridable] is false, since an overridable target's omissions are spread

 * supplied" (the default is dead) for any target. Neither claim is made when [inline] is true.
 *
 * [targetClassName] is set only for an [ProbeKind.OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] probe whose target lives in
 * another class: a Scala constructor getter declared on a companion module class, whose target
 * constructor lives on the class the module compiles for. It is null when the target is in the
 * probe's own class, and always null for Kotlin. A collector joins an omission probe to its
 * target's METHOD probe by [targetClassName] when set, otherwise by [className].
 *
 * [calls] is set only for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe: the in-scope call edges read from that
 * method's own bytecode at transform time. A pass-through's callees are attributed to whatever
 * probed method referenced it, so they never appear under the pass-through's own name.
 *
 * [inlinedFromClassName] is set only for a [ProbeKind.BRANCH] probe that is a kept inlined copy:
 * a site inside code kotlinc copied from an inline function's body into this probe's own method,
 * whose origin class is in scope. Dotted, or null when the probe is the class's own code.
 *
 * [generatedBy] is set for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe, for a [ProbeKind.BRANCH] probe as the
 * mark of the method it sits in, and for a [ProbeKind.OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] probe as its target's
 * mark. See [GeneratedBy].
 *
 * [referencedClasses] is set only for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe: the out-of-scope classes this
 * method's own bytecode references, dotted. A reference is wider than a call edge, since
 * runtime-visible annotations, casts and type tests, types in a descriptor or generic signature,
 * catch types and class literals all count. Classes the bootstrap or platform loader provides, and
 * classes read from a directory on the classpath, are never listed. A name's [ExternalClass] entry
 * may arrive on a later manifest than the name itself, since it is resolved only once the startup
 * listing has finished; a name that never gets one belongs to no dependency (a jar of the adopter's
 * own, an agent jar) and a collector ignores it.
 *
 * [branchKey] is set only for a [ProbeKind.BRANCH] probe: an opaque lowercase hex token naming
 * this outcome across builds and instances, compared only for equality. Null when the agent
 * cannot name the outcome safely.
 *
 * [lambdaBody] is set only for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe. It is true when an `invokedynamic` in
 * the method's own class names it as the `LambdaMetafactory` implementation, directly or through
 * the boxing forwarder scalac puts in between, and its name is one a compiler gives a body the
 * source never named. A body Scala 3 lifted out of a nested class, whose creator stays in that
 * class, is marked by its expanded name alone. A named method passed by reference is not a lambda
 * body. See [dev.otherlode.instrumentation.TypeMatchPolicy.isLambdaBodyName].
 *
 * [branchSites] is set only for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe: the method's kept branch sites, in
 * [BranchSite.siteIndex] order. A dropped site is not listed, and the type initializer's probe
 * lists none.
 *
 * [siteIndex] is set only for a [ProbeKind.BRANCH] probe. It names the site this outcome belongs
 * to, which the METHOD probe of the same method lists in [branchSites].
 *
 * [static] is set only for a [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe. It is true when the method has
 * `ACC_STATIC`, and false for a constructor and for the type initializer's probe, whose meaning a
 * consumer takes from its name.
 *
 * [parameterNames], [genericSignature] and [extensionReceiver] are set only for a
 * [ProbeKind.METHOD] probe, and are empty or false for the type initializer's probe.
 * [parameterNames] holds one name per descriptor parameter, in order, from the `MethodParameters`
 * attribute when it names every parameter, and otherwise from the LocalVariableTable. It is empty
 * when the class file names none or only some of them. [genericSignature] is the method's
 * `Signature` attribute as written, or empty. [extensionReceiver] is true when the first name
 * starts with `$this$` or is `$receiver`.
 *
 * [unreadShape] says the probe's code has the outline of compiler output whose body the agent has
 * not read; see [UnreadShape]. It is exclusive with [generatedBy], which the wire cannot carry
 * together with it, so building a location with both set fails.
