/**
 * Pins what an [EndpointModule] that implements only the two required members inherits.
 *
 * Each default exists so that the common module needs no boilerplate, and each is load-bearing:
 * `bootModulesNeedingSeamRead` returning an empty set is what stops
 * `EndpointInstrumentation` adding a read edge for a module that instruments no JDK module,
 * `handlerInterfaces` returning an empty set is what keeps the lambda factory hook out of a JVM
 * whose modules never take a handler lambda, and
 * `declare` doing nothing is what lets every framework whose routes are readable from a
 * registration hook's own arguments ignore the seam's declare path entirely, and
 * `beforeManifest` doing nothing is what leaves every module that needs no deadline untouched by it. A default that
 * silently changed to something else would be a behaviour change in every module that leans on it,
 * so they are asserted here rather than left to the modules that happen to inherit them.
