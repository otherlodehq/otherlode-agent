# Classes a framework generates at runtime are left alone, recognised by the generator's own naming

A CGLIB proxy is named after the class it proxies, so it lands in the adopter's own package and no
`includePackages` rule can tell it apart. One `@Bean`-bearing `@Configuration` class in
`demo-spring` made Spring generate three: the enhanced subclass and two fast-class helpers. Every
one matched the type matcher, was woven, registered, and reported. The demo's manifest went from 15
probes to 289, its never-hit list from 4 rows to 230, and its unreached clusters from 4 to 16. The
report read "dead: 81.3%", and the 220 new never-hit rows all named methods with names like
`CGLIB$BIND_CALLBACKS` at line -1, in a class with no source file, that nobody can delete.

That is the failure mode ADR 0007 exists to rule out, arriving from the other side: not a real class
missing from the report, but a report so full of generated code that the real findings are four rows
in two hundred and thirty. The three classes also tripped the static-scan blind-spot warning ADR
0014 added, which is meant to tell an adopter their deployment loads code the scan cannot see. A
proxy has no `.class` file anywhere, so it fires that warning every time, and a diagnostic that
cries wolf on every Spring application is worth less than no diagnostic.

A class generated at runtime is therefore **not instrumented**, recognised by the markers the
generator puts in the name. The class it proxies is instrumented as usual, which is where the signal
actually lives: a proxy reaches the method it overrides through `super`, so the real class's probes
fire. `demo-spring`'s `PricingConfiguration` is fully hit with the rule in place.

## Considered options

- **Leaving them in.** Rejected on the numbers above. There is also nothing to do with the rows: a
  generated class's name carries a counter or a hash from the order its generator happened to
  produce it in, so two instances of one service disagree about the name and a collector can never
  merge them into "never hit across the fleet", which is the claim this project exists to make.
- **Recognising them structurally, from the bytecode, rather than by name.** Rejected: every
  structural signal collides with something real. Spring's CGLIB classes are not `ACC_SYNTHETIC`,
  and they do carry a `SourceFile` attribute, reading `<generated>` (confirmed with `javap` over the
  classes Spring generated for the demo, dumped with `-Dcglib.debugLocation`). The one thing they
  genuinely lack is line numbers, and that is exactly what a class compiled without debug info lacks
  too, which ADR 0026 decided to keep and label rather than drop. A `SourceFile` value that does not
  look like a file name would work for CGLIB, but it is a name rule wearing a different hat, and a
  narrower one: ByteBuddy and JDK proxies write no `SourceFile` at all.
- **Turning away any class name containing `$$`.** Rejected: kotlinc puts `$$` in the name of the
  class it generates for a lambda passed to an inlined function
  (`OrdersKt$special$$inlined$sortedBy$1`), and that class holds the adopter's own body. A test pins
  it.
- **Asking the classloader whether a `.class` resource exists for the name.** This is the rule with
  the right meaning, since what makes a generated class unreportable is that no artifact carries its
  name. Rejected for v1: it fails the wrong way. A loader that serves bytes without exposing them as
  resources, which an app server or an OSGi container may do, would make the agent silently skip the
  adopter's real code, and it puts a resource lookup on the class-loading path of every class the
  agent instruments. A name rule that misses an unknown generator leaves visible noise; this one
  hides real findings.
- **Skipping them and reporting the skip**, the way ADR 0007 reports a class ByteBuddy cannot safely
  redefine. Rejected: those two are different claims. A skipped class is one the agent wanted to
  instrument and could not, which an adopter should know about; a generated class holds no code the
  adopter wrote, so there is nothing to tell them. This follows ADR 0025's coroutine-continuation
  classes, which are excluded and not reported, rather than ADR 0007's.

## Consequences

- The rule lives in `TypeMatchPolicy.isRuntimeGenerated`, applied in `typeNameMatcher`, so the live
  matcher and the static baseline scanner share it, as they must for every other shape rule. The
  scanner walks `.class` files and can never meet a generated class, so this costs it nothing.
- `LoadedClassSweep` mirrors it, as it already mirrors the synthetic flag and the
  coroutine-continuation check. Without that, the forward direction of ADR 0027's sweep would report
  every generated class as one no transformer saw, which is the blind-spot false alarm again in a
  different bucket.
- The markers are `$$SpringCGLIB$$` (Spring 6 and 7) and `BySpringCGLIB$$` (Spring 5.3, which tags
  the generating class's simple name in front of it: `$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$`,
  `$$FastClassBySpringCGLIB$$`). Both were read out of `SpringNamingPolicy` and `DefaultNamingPolicy`
  in spring-core 5.3.39, 6.2.19 and 7.0.9, not recalled. `endpoints-spring-webmvc` supports 5.3, so
  both spellings have to be covered.
- Spring and Hibernate were covered first, because only those two had been confirmed against their
  own source and run end to end. The cost of a missing marker is the noise above, which is visible
  and loud, not a silent wrong claim.
- ByteBuddy, Mockito, javassist and JDK proxies were added on 2026-09-26, ahead of release rather
  than waiting for an adopter to show one. A default `ByteBuddy` instance names a type
  `<base>$ByteBuddy$<random>`, and Mockito names a subclass mock `<mocked>$MockitoMock$<random>`,
  in the mocked type's package, so a test JVM mocking an adopter's interface puts one inside the
  include prefix. The tail is `RandomString.make()`'s eight characters from all 62 letters and
  digits, or fifteen for Mockito under GraalVM. javassist's `ProxyFactory` appends
  `_$$_jvst<hex>_<hex counter>`. The JDK names a proxy `$Proxy<n>` and puts it in the package of a
  non-public interface it implements, otherwise in `jdk.proxyN`; a proxy class is final and not
  synthetic. Read out of ByteBuddy 1.18.12, mockito-core 5.14.2, javassist 3.30.2-GA and
  `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` in JDK 11, 21 and 22.
- The JDK's name is matched as the whole simple name. ByteBuddy's and Mockito's markers are matched
  as a whole part followed by a part of exactly eight or fifteen letters and digits that does not
  read as one word (an optional capital, then lower-case letters). kotlinc names a body class after
  its enclosing function, so `fun ByteBuddy()` holding an object expression gives
  `Power$ByteBuddy$1`, and a class nested in one the adopter named `ByteBuddy` gives
  `Config$ByteBuddy$Settings`; both are kept. A random tail reads as one word about once in five
  hundred names (analytically about 1 in 522), and that miss is visible noise. A name of two or more
  words of the right length (`Config$ByteBuddy$HttpPort`) is still turned away: about one random
  tail in thirty takes that shape, too many to let through, and it needs a class the adopter named
  `ByteBuddy` or `MockitoMock` to begin with.
- The rule took three review rounds on 2026-09-26. The first cut took any part after the marker and
  turned `Power$auxiliary$1` away; the second took eight or more characters and turned
  `Config$ByteBuddy$Settings` away; the third added the word-shape rule and would have brought
  `$auxiliary$` back, until the review found it turned away `Power$auxiliary$UserInfo`.
- ByteBuddy's auxiliary types, `<instrumented>$auxiliary$<tail>`, are not covered in any naming
  mode. The default tail is eight random letters and digits
  (`AuxiliaryType.NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom`, which the `ByteBuddy` constructor uses when no
  property is set); under the fixed, caller or numeric mode it is the type's own `getSuffix()`,
  seven to fifteen characters. `fun auxiliary()` is a plausible name, and a local class in it,
  `Power$auxiliary$UserInfo`, has the same shape, so matching the marker would turn the adopter's
  code away.
- `RuntimeGeneratedClassTest` has ByteBuddy, javassist and the JDK each define a class in the
  fixture package under the installed agent, confirms the transformer is offered it, and checks it
  is neither woven, skipped nor swept. Mockito is not a test dependency; its name shape is made with
  ByteBuddy's own `SuffixingRandom("MockitoMock")`. The test seeds the random tails, so it does not
  depend on the one-in-five-hundred chance.
- Not covered either: Mockito's named-module helpers (`$MockitoModuleProbe$`, `InjectionBase$<n>`).
  Weld names its own proxies and was not read.
- ByteBuddy's fixed and caller naming modes, which a JVM selects with `-Dnet.bytebuddy.naming=fixed`
  or `caller`, name a type `<base>$ByteBuddy`, the caller mode with the calling class and method
  between as parts of their own, and no random tail (`ByteBuddy`'s static initialiser and
  `NamingStrategy.Suffixing.BaseNameResolver.WithCallerSuffix`, 1.18.12). That shape is also a
  nested class an adopter could name `ByteBuddy`, so a last part of `ByteBuddy` counts only when
  the JVM's own property selects one of those modes; the agent runs in the same JVM and reads the
  same property. It reads it once, while the agent starts, so the type matcher, the baseline scan
  and the sweep never disagree about a class. ByteBuddy reads it later, when its own class first
  initialises, so a value the application sets in code before that is seen by ByteBuddy and not by
  the agent, which then weaves those classes: visible noise. A numeric value seeds the main type's
  random tail, already covered. GraalVM native images pick the caller mode too, but a Java agent
  never runs in one. The property name is put together at runtime, since the shaded jar relocates
  `net.bytebuddy` and would rewrite the literal into the agent's own relocated property.
- Hibernate (added 2026-09-23) generates four kinds of class beside an entity: the lazy-loading
  proxy, the basic proxy, the instantiator and the access optimizer (with, in 6.6 and later, the
  optimizer's bridge). 6.6 and 7.4 name the first three `<Entity>$HibernateProxy`,
  `$HibernateBasicProxy` and `$HibernateInstantiator` with nothing after them, through
  `ByteBuddyState.FixedNamingStrategy`; the optimizer and its bridge carry `encodeName`'s hex digit
  and property names straight after the suffix, or ByteBuddy's `$<random>` when that would pass
  the JVM's name limit. 5.6 used `SuffixingRandom` for all four, `<Entity>$HibernateProxy$<random>`,
  with a second `$` under `hibernate.bytecode.enforce_legacy_proxy_classnames`. All of it was read
  out of hibernate-core 5.6.15, 6.6.58 and 7.4.10 and ByteBuddy 1.18.12's `NamingStrategy`. The
  `$HibernateProxy$` marker this ADR first guessed would have missed every 6.x and 7.x proxy.
  A scratch program driving 7.4.10's own generators under the agent confirmed all four kinds reach
  the transformer and were woven before the rule and are not after.
- Hibernate's suffixes are matched as a whole `$`-separated part of the name after the first, not
  as a substring the way Spring's markers are. Spring's `$$SpringCGLIB$$` is not something a person
  names a class, but `Util$HibernateProxyUnwrapper` is, and an over-match hides the adopter's real
  code, which is the worse direction to fail in. The access optimizer is the one prefix match,
  since its encoded tail is open-ended: the part must be the suffix alone, or the suffix (or
  `...Bridge`) followed by a lower-case hex digit.
- An adopter who genuinely wants a generated class instrumented has no way to ask for it. Nobody has
  wanted one.
- The endpoint pipeline ignores the same classes. A proxy of a JAX-RS resource inherits its annotations' meaning and calls the real method through `super`, so weaving both counted every call twice. Added 2026-10-03 in a review.
- The JAX-RS endpoint module also turns away a synthetic class, as the method tier does. Quarkus ArC's `<Bean>_Subclass` and `<Bean>_ClientProxy` extend the resource class and carry `ACC_SYNTHETIC` (Gizmo's default, which ArC never clears), so once ADR 0020's gate opened for Quarkus REST they could be read as resources of their own, a resource's own methods woven in the proxy too, and each request counted two or three times. No ArC name is needed in the list above. Added 2026-10-18 in a review.
