# A run names its namespace and reads OpenTelemetry's own settings

Decided on 2026-09-26 in a grilling session that spanned this repo, the collector and `otherlode-server` (server ADR 0038, collector ADR 0002). This extends ADR 0016.

The server keys a service by its namespace and its name, as OpenTelemetry's `service.namespace` and `service.name` do, so the agent has to send a namespace. An adopter who already runs OpenTelemetry has also set these values once, in OpenTelemetry's own settings. Asking them to set every value again in Otherlode's names is extra work, and the two sets of names drift apart. A service's findings should carry the same name as its traces.

## The design

- A new `serviceNamespace` option, `otherlode.service.namespace` / `OTHERLODE_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` by ADR 0016's rule. It has no default. `ResourceAttributes` gains `optional string service_namespace = 6`, sent only when set.
- The service name, the namespace and the environment each resolve from the first source that gives a value that is not blank:
  1. Otherlode's own sources, in ADR 0016's order: the `-javaagent` args, then the system property, then the `OTHERLODE_*` environment variable.
  2. OpenTelemetry's own settings, resolved as its Java agent resolves them: each of `otel.service.name` and `otel.resource.attributes` from its system property, else its environment variable; the name from `otel.service.name`, else `service.name` in the attributes.
  3. For the name only, detection in the order OpenTelemetry's Java agent uses: the Spring Boot application name, then the main jar manifest's `Implementation-Title`, then the jar's file name.
  4. For the name only, OpenTelemetry's default `unknown_service:java`.

  The keys read from a resource-attributes list are `service.name`, `service.namespace`, and `deployment.environment.name` then the older `deployment.environment`. Each OpenTelemetry setting is taken whole from one place, as in OpenTelemetry's Java agent: a set `otel.resource.attributes` system property hides `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` entirely, and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` wins over a `service.name` inside that system property. Values are trimmed, and a blank one falls through to the next source.
- A service name or namespace that is `.` or `..` after trimming is skipped with a warning, and the next source gives the value. The server shows a service at a URL path that holds both, and browsers drop dot segments even when they are escaped, so a namespace `..` would lead to another service. The collector rejects such a payload too (collector ADR 0002).
- The agent never works out a namespace for itself. In Kubernetes the OpenTelemetry Operator derives `service.namespace` from a pod annotation or the pod's namespace, and it writes the result into `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`. The agent reads that like any other value.

## Considered options

- Only Otherlode's own names. Rejected: every adopter already on OpenTelemetry would set each value twice, and a typo in one place would give Otherlode and the traces two names for one service.
- Deriving the namespace from the pod's Kubernetes namespace when nothing names one. Rejected: many teams use one Kubernetes namespace per environment, so this would split one service in two. Without the Operator, OpenTelemetry derives no namespace either, and Otherlode's names would then disagree with the traces.
- Keeping the default name `unknown-service`. Rejected: two services with no name on different hosts would share one identity, and OpenTelemetry's form lets the server mark such a service as "name not set".
- Reading only `deployment.environment.name`. Rejected: setups older than semantic conventions 1.27 still send `deployment.environment`.

## Consequences

- The name detection reads the application's own Spring Boot configuration and jar, so it runs when the agent starts. It never loads application classes.
- An adopter who sets both an Otherlode name and an OpenTelemetry name gets the Otherlode one. That is how the service can be named differently in Otherlode on purpose.

## Amended on 2026-10-04: the service version, and never the instance id

Settled with Luke in the pre-release review of option names (`STATUS.md` checklist item 4), since a fallback added after release changes what a running deployment reports. The service version resolves like the namespace: Otherlode's own three sources, then `service.version` in OpenTelemetry's resource attributes, else unset. `service.instance.id` is never read from OpenTelemetry. A copied deployment template gives every replica the same value, which OpenTelemetry tolerates as an attribute, but here the instance is the stream hits merge in. A pinned instance id comes only from `serviceInstanceId`, set on purpose.
