# Skip and report classes that cannot be instrumented safely

ByteBuddy refuses to redefine a class carrying an annotation whose `@Target` does not include `TYPE`. Kotlin's `@file:JvmName` is the common case: kotlinc attaches it to the class file even though its target list does not allow that. Otherlode's type matcher excludes such a class before ByteBuddy commits to rebasing it, and records the skip with a reason. Any other transform failure is caught by `TransformResultListener`, which records the skip the same way. Nothing reaches the registry until that same listener sees the rewrite succeed, so a class whose bytes never passed validation was never published to withdraw: a rollback could not have helped, since a flush landing before it would already have sent the probes. This covers every failure ByteBuddy reports; one past `getBytes()`, such as the verifier rejecting the woven class, is outside what any listener sees and is recorded in `STATUS.md`. Skipped classes travel to the collector in the manifest's `skipped_classes` list. "Not instrumented" is an honest state to report; "in the manifest, permanently zero" is not.

The wider rule this sets: missing data must never read as a confident dead-code answer. The static baseline (0014) puts classes it cannot read, cannot instrument, or has nothing to probe into their own buckets rather than declaring them. The test collector throws `UnknownProbeException` for a probe it has never seen instead of returning false, and refuses to answer `neverLoaded` until a scan has arrived in full.

## Considered options

- `TypeStrategy.DECORATE`, which OpenTelemetry's agent uses and which skips the validation that fails here. Rejected: DECORATE does not allow `defineField`, which 0003 depends on. OTel can use it because it keeps state in a per-instance virtual field, the wrong shape for per-class counters.
- A generated companion class per instrumented class holding the array. Rejected: the failure comes from redefining the target class at all, not from adding a field, so a companion changes nothing and doubles the loaded class count.
- Checking inside the transform callback. Does not work: `AgentBuilder` commits to rebasing a type the moment it matches `.type(...)`, so only the type matcher can keep a class out of the path that fails.

## Consequences

Amended 2026-10-04 by 0058. The type-matcher exclusion described above is gone: the annotation check fired only because ByteBuddy's type validation was on, and with it off a `@file:JvmName` class weaves. "A no-op transform crashes identically" held only under validation. The listener half of this decision stands: a class ByteBuddy still cannot rebase is recorded as skipped and logged.

The blast radius is small. `@file:JvmName` is mostly a library-author idiom, not something controllers and handlers reach for. Adding a field during a first-load transform is well established (JaCoCo has done it for over a decade); the ByteBuddy restriction on adding fields applies to retransforming already-loaded classes, which Otherlode never does (0013).
