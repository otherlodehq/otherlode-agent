# Scala's case-class plumbing, static forwarders and object serialization are marked generated

Decided on 2026-09-26, after the first run of the Scala fixtures against the real collector and
server (`runShapesStack`). The never-hit list for each Scala service was mostly compiler output.
A case class `Cc` gave rows for `canEqual`, `copy`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `productElement` and its
`Name` variants, `unapply`, `fromProduct`, `curried` and `tupled`, and its companion's
`toString` and `writeReplace`; each also rooted its own uncalled cluster. Every method of an
`object` showed twice: once on `Driver$`, where the code is, and once on `Driver` at line -1, the
static forwarder scalac adds. Fourteen uncalled methods gave twenty-eight rows.

Kotlin had the same problems and settled them: ADR 0026 marks a data class's generated methods,
and ADR 0041 marks a multi-file facade's forwarders and passes calls through them. Scala gets the
same treatment, read from bytecode shape only, with no `ScalaSig` or TASTy decoding.

## The design

- **Three new `GeneratedBy` values.** `CASE_CLASS = 7` for case-class and companion plumbing,
  `STATIC_FORWARDER = 8`, and `SCALA_OBJECT = 9` for an object's serialization plumbing. Additive
  on the wire. Consumers judge findings on "not `NONE`", so a marked method is kept, counted and
  left out of never-hit rows and the cluster graph, as for every other value.
- **A static forwarder** is a method, in a class carrying a `Scala` or `ScalaSig` attribute, that
  is static, not synthetic, not a bridge, and whose body is exactly `getstatic
  <ThisClass>$.MODULE$`, each parameter loaded in order, `invokevirtual
  <ThisClass>$.<same name><same descriptor>`, and a return. The owner must be the class's own `$`
  twin. A static forwarder is a generated forwarder in ADR 0041's sense: a call into it passes
  through to the object's method, and it is never a graph node.
- **A case class** is a class carrying a Scala attribute that declares `canEqual(Object)`,
  `productArity()`, `productElement(int)` and `productPrefix()`. It is not required to list
  `scala.Product` among its interfaces: Scala 2.13.15 leaves it off when a supertype already brings
  it, as in the recommended ADT shape `sealed trait Shape extends Product with Serializable`. A case
  object's module class passes the same test, and its plumbing is marked the same way.
- **Each piece of plumbing is recognised by its body**, the fixed code scalac writes for it, never
  by where it sits in the source. `canEqual` is `instanceof` the class; `productPrefix` loads the
  class's name; `productArity` pushes the element count; `copy` and the companion's `apply`
  construct the class from their parameters through its primary constructor, never an auxiliary
  one; `toString` calls `ScalaRunTime._toString`;
  `hashCode` is the MurmurHash3 fold over `productPrefix` and each element (or
  `ScalaRunTime._hashCode` with no primitive element); `equals` is the reference shortcut,
  `instanceof`, a comparison per element and `canEqual` (left out, as scalac leaves it out, when
  the class is final and its `canEqual` is scalac's own, or in Scala 2 when a final class has no
  elements); `productElement` and
  `productElementName` dispatch over the elements and fail out of range; `productIterator` and
  `productElementNames` delegate to the runtime; Scala 3's `_N` and Scala 2's `<name>$access$<i>`
  read one element, `_N` only in a Scala 3 class and `$access$N` only in a Scala 2 one. The
  elements are the fields the primary constructor stores its leading parameters in, element i from
  parameter i, and `productArity` must push their count. A matcher allows nothing the shape does not name: one
  extra instruction and the method is ordinary code. The shapes were read with `javap -c` from
  fixtures compiled with Scala 2.13.15 and 3.3.4, across every primitive type, references,
  generics, one and zero elements, private parameters, inner and local classes, and several
  parameter lists; a body from another version, or a shape not read, stays unmarked. A field
  accessor (`a()` for `case class Cc(a: Int)`) is never plumbing: the adopter declared it.
- **A hand-written method is marked only when its body is exactly what scalac writes**, and then it
  is the generated code in all but authorship: a hand-written `copy` that only constructs the class
  from its parameters, as in the `HandCopy` fixture, is marked, and so is its default getter's
  omission probe. Any other override (`toString` returning a literal, `hashCode` returning a
  constant, `equals` comparing other or fewer elements, `apply` or `copy` going through an
  auxiliary constructor) stays ordinary. A class that is not a case class but implements `Product`
  by hand with the same four methods, written the way scalac writes them, is marked the same way:
  its label is wrong, and its code is the generated shape. `productArity` is marked only when
  `productElement` matched too, whose dispatch carries the real element count, so a hand-written
  `productArity` returning any other count stays ordinary.
- **The companion's plumbing**: in the class named `X$` whose partner `X` passes the case-class
  test, found by reading `X`'s bytes through the companion's loader as a resource, never loading
  it, as ADR 0023 does for constructor getters. A static `MODULE$` is not required, so the
  companions of inner and local case classes count. `apply` constructing `X`, `unapply` (Scala 3's
  identity or boolean; Scala 2's `None` or `Some` of the element or a tuple), `toString` loading the
  name, and Scala 3's `fromProduct` rebuilding `X` from `productElement` calls are marked
  `CASE_CLASS`, each by its body. A hand-written `apply(String)` in an explicit companion has a
  different body and stays ordinary. Unreadable partner bytes mark nothing.
- **An object's `writeReplace`**: in a Scala class with a static `MODULE$` field, a private
  `writeReplace()Ljava/lang/Object;` whose body constructs a `scala.runtime.ModuleSerializationProxy`
  is marked `SCALA_OBJECT`. Scala 3 gives every `object` one, and Scala 2 every case-class
  companion.
- **Omission probes follow.** An omission probe already takes its target method's mark, so
  `copy$default$N` and Scala 2's `apply$default$N` are marked with `copy` and `apply`; a
  constructor's own defaults stay the adopter's.

The rules above replaced a line rule before the first commit, on 2026-09-26. The first cut
marked a method from the plumbing set when its line table named the `case class` declaration line.
Three review rounds, each compiling scratch code with scalac 2.13.15 and 3.3.4, found a layout that
broke it: parameters wrapped over several lines (Scala 2 starts the constructor's table at the
first parameter), a span bounded by the constructor (a body `val` puts its initialiser there), by
the field accessors (a body `val` has one), and by the `copy` default getters (a hand-written `copy`
with a default puts its getter in the body), besides implicit second parameter lists and inner
companions. The line table only says where a method sits, and scalac's placement follows layout
the adopter controls; worse, a wrong span marked hand-written code and hid it. The body is fixed
compiler output whatever the layout, and it is how this project recognises every other generated
shape.

## Considered options

- **Not probing static forwarders at all**, as ADR 0047 does for Hibernate's enhancement methods.
  Agent-only and no wire change. Rejected for consistency: a static forwarder stands for the
  adopter's own object method, which is the Kotlin multi-file facade's situation, and ADR 0041
  kept and marked those. A consumer should see Scala and Kotlin forwarders the same way.
- **Position in the source: the declaration line, then a declaration span.** Rejected at review,
  above: it depends on the adopter's layout and fails by hiding hand-written code.
- **A name policy at the collector.** Rejected as in ADR 0026: it exists in no repo, and a name
  alone cannot tell a hand-written override from compiler output.
- **Decoding `ScalaSig` or TASTy for the case and synthetic flags.** Exact, but it is a pickle
  format per Scala major version, and the bytecode shape already carries what is needed.
- **Folding `writeReplace` into `CASE_CLASS`.** Rejected: a plain Scala 3 `object` is not a case
  class, and a label that says so misleads.

## Consequences

- A Scala 3 enum's parameterised case compiles to a final case class and is marked as one,
  companion included. A singleton case's `productPrefix` and `toString` read a field rather than
  load a constant and stay unmarked, and the enum class's own plumbing (`values`, `valueOf`,
  `ordinal`, `fromOrdinal`, `$new`) was not read. Nor are Scala 2 `Enumeration` and `lazy val`
  plumbing. The fixtures have Scala 3 enums, but no
  run has loaded them; `STATUS.md` carries them until a run shows what they produce.
- `otherlode-server` displays an unknown `GeneratedBy` as `none` until it gains labels for the three
  values, though it already leaves such methods out of findings.
- Every fact above was read from `javap` output for fixtures compiled with Scala 2.13.15 and
  3.3.4. Other versions (2.12, later 3.x) degrade to unmarked plumbing until their shapes are read.
- Symbolic or backquoted names, value-class elements, an `Array` element (scalac compares it by
  reference, a shape not read), a `Unit` element, a `var` parameter not stored with the others, a
  parameter scalac aliases to a superclass `val`, a local case class that captures a local value
  (its constructor takes the capture beside the elements) are not recognised and stay unmarked. (Scala 2 writes no
  `unapply` past 22 elements, so there is nothing to recognise there.)
- Amended on 2026-10-03 by ADR 0052: the shapes this record reads are read from the class file, not the received bytes, so an earlier transformer such as JaCoCo leaves them unchanged.

## Amended on 2026-10-03: every release's bodies, keyed on the release where it is known

The consequence that other versions "degrade to unmarked plumbing until their shapes are read" turned out to cover current patch releases, not only old and future lines. The agent's matcher over scalac 2.12.18 to 3.10.0-RC3 found, all from the compiler and none from the library:

- `hashCode` folds `productPrefix().hashCode()` into a constant, or calls `MurmurHash3.productHash` with no primitive element, from 2.13.17, 3.3.7 and 3.7.1. 2.12 mixes no prefix at all.
- `equals` compares a null-safe reference element through `Objects.equals` in 3.3.8, 3.8.4 and 3.9.0, and compares every element through an `astore` copy from 3.7.3 to 3.8.3. 2.12 compares in source order.
- Scala 3's companion `fromProduct` unboxes into locals before `new` from 3.7.0.
- `productElement` and `productElementName` fail out of range with `new IndexOutOfBoundsException(int)` from 3.9.0; 2.12 with `new IndexOutOfBoundsException(Integer.toString(n))`.
- 2.12 gives every module class a private `readResolve()` returning `MODULE$`, its counterpart of `writeReplace`. It was unmarked.

Every one of these variants is read and recognised. 2.12's `readResolve` is marked `SCALA_OBJECT`. Scala 3 enum plumbing (the enum class's `values`, `valueOf`, `ordinal`, `fromOrdinal` and `$new`, and a singleton case's `productPrefix`, `toString` and, from 3.3.7, `hashCode`) is read now too, since enums are everyday code; `lazy val` plumbing, value-class elements and the other shapes listed above still wait.

A body that fails its rule is no longer always ordinary. For a Scala 3 class whose `.tasty` names a release the agent has read, it is: that release writes the read shape, so a different body was written by hand. Otherwise it is an unread shape (ADR 0054). The list of read releases and the fixtures behind it are ADR 0055's.
