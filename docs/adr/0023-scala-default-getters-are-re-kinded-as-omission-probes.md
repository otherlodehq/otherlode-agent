# Scala default getters are re-kinded as omission probes on their target, with a cross-class target for constructors

Scala compiles each optional parameter to a public, non-synthetic default getter named `f$default$N`, one-based across every parameter list, which a call that omits the parameter invokes before calling `f`. The method tier already gives that getter a slot, so its hit total is already the parameter's omission total. The agent reports that same slot as an `OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT` probe on the target (`f`, its descriptor, `parameter_index = N - 1`, the name from the target's LocalVariableTable, `overridable` from the target's flags) and gives the getter no METHOD probe, the same shape Kotlin's omission probes already have on the wire. No new slot, no hot-path change, no layout-hash change: only the manifest row differs.

The target is resolved from bytecode in the getter's own class: a same-named non-getter method with at least N parameters, whose parameter N erases to the getter's return type (or is `scala.Function0`, since a by-name parameter's getter returns the value type), and whose parameters start with the getter's own, because a getter for a later parameter list takes every earlier list's parameters. The compiler forbids two overloads of one name both declaring defaults, so more than one survivor is a shape bytecode cannot tell apart. No survivor or several leaves the getter as an ordinary METHOD probe under its own name, with one INFO line. A Scala `inline def` with a default always lands there: its getter is emitted and called, but the function itself has no bytecode.

Constructor defaults cross a class boundary. The getter `$lessinit$greater$default$N` lives on the companion module class `Foo$`, with a static forwarder on `Foo`, while the target `<init>` lives on `Foo`. `ProbeLocation` gains an additive `target_class_name`, empty when the target is in the probe's own class and never set for Kotlin, and the agent resolves the constructor by reading `Foo`'s bytes through the module class's loader as a resource, never by loading it. A collector joins an omission probe to its target on the target class when set, otherwise the probe's own class. Wherever a person or a test names the parameter (the server's optional-parameter rows, the testkit's `omissionCount`), the class is the target's.

## Considered options

- Keeping the getter as a METHOD probe and adding a label. Rejected: the two findings need the parameter's identity (target name and descriptor, index, overridable), so the label would grow into every field `OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT` already carries, and every consumer would handle two shapes for one concept.
- Reporting a constructor getter's target as `<init>` and having the collector strip the module class's trailing `$` by convention. Rejected: a convention hidden on both sides of the wire, and the agent still needs `Foo`'s bytes for the descriptor.
- Skipping constructors in the first version. Rejected: case-class constructor defaults are the most common Scala default, and the field that covers them is additive.
- Special-casing Scala 2.13's `apply$default$N` onto the companion constructor. Rejected: the same rules resolve it against `Cc$.apply` in the same class; the resulting soft spot is documented below rather than patched.

## Consequences

- `parameter_index` counts a Scala extension receiver, because it is an ordinary first JVM parameter and the getter's N counts it. Kotlin's definition ("receivers not counted") is unchanged; the proto comment records the difference.
- A subclass can override the getter and the target independently, so a getter on `Base` may count omissions for a receiver whose `f` is `Sub`'s. The collector rule already handles this: never-supplied is claimed only for a non-overridable target.
- The trait's static accessor `t$default$1$` and forwarder `t$` are not getters and stay METHOD probes, a collector name policy like `componentN`. A trait implementer's own `t$default$1` is a synthetic bridge and gets no slot; the trait's default method does.
- `copy$default$N` on a case class re-kinds onto `copy` and is filtered by name at the collector, the existing `copy$default` policy.
- Scala 2.13 emits `apply$default$N` for the `Cc()` path and inlines `apply` at the call site, so that target is never hit and the constructor getters count only `new Cc()` omissions. Scala 3 routes both paths through the constructor getters. Documented, not corrected.
- A constructor's static forwarder on the class itself (`Cc.$lessinit$greater$default$N`) resolves in class to the same `<init>` the module getter resolves to across the boundary, so one parameter can carry two omission probes. An optional parameter's omission total is therefore the sum over every omission probe that names it, within one instance; a consumer that judges each probe on its own reports the forwarder's zero as "always supplied" beside the module getter's "never supplied".
- The static baseline is unchanged: a getter is a declared method and never-loaded claims are class-level.

## Amended on 2026-10-31 by ADR 0080

A trait's forwarder `t$` is marked `TRAIT_FORWARDER` by its body, and so is the forwarder each class that mixes the trait in gets. The collector name policy this record named was never built. The static default-getter accessor `t$default$N$` is unchanged.
