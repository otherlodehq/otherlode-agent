# String and enum switches are read back to their source cases

Decided on 2026-09-24 with ADR 0037. This amends ADR 0031's rule that a switch outcome is keyed by its case key value.

A `when` or `switch` over a string or an enum does not reach the bytecode as one switch over the values the source names. Over an enum, javac and kotlinc switch on a synthetic mapping array (javac's `$SwitchMap$`, kotlinc's `$WhenMappings`) indexed by `ordinal()`. Its values run 1 to n in the order the cases appear. Over a string, the source switch becomes a `lookupswitch` on `hashCode()`, then `equals` checks, and in javac a second switch on an index those checks set. Each of those jumps is a branch site today. The person sees outcomes named by hash codes and mapping numbers, and the hash switch's outcomes say nothing about the source. The key suffers too: a mapping number is a case's position, so adding a case earlier in the `when` renumbers every case after it and gives each one a new key. ADR 0031 promised that adding a case leaves every other case's key alone. For an enum it does not hold.

## The design

- **One site per source switch, where the lowering has one.** When a lowering ends in a switch whose cases are the source's cases, that switch is the site, and its cases are relabelled. This holds for javac's and kotlinc's switch on a mapped enum value, javac's second switch on a string's index, and the switch after javac's `SwitchBootstraps.typeSwitch` and `enumSwitch`. An enum case is named by its constant, read from the mapping class's static initialiser. The class's bytes are read through the loader as a resource and never loaded, the way ADR 0023 reads a constructor's class. A string case is named by its literal, read from the `equals` checks, and a pattern case by its bootstrap argument. A `null` case, from kotlinc's `null ->` on a nullable enum or javac's `case null`, is named `null`. Two labels on one body are still two outcomes, as the glossary's branch site entry says. Cases are listed in the switch instruction's order, which is also slot order. For an enum that follows each constant's first appearance across the whole class, so it can differ from the order one `when` names them.
- **Equals checks stay sites where it has none.** kotlinc's string `when` and scalac's string `match` jump from each `equals` check straight into the case body, with no second switch. There the `hashCode` switch and the subject's null check are dropped, and each `equals` check stays an ordinary conditional site, whose condition reads `subject == "literal"` or `subject != "literal"`. Scala enums, `Enumeration` values and sealed objects compile to `equals` chains with no switch at all, so they are plain sites already.
- **The lowering's own jumps are machinery.** Around a rebuilt site, the `hashCode` switch, the `equals` checks and any null check on the subject are dropped like coroutine machinery under ADR 0025. They keep their place in the numbering and get no probe. A compiler-added default that only throws, as for an exhaustive `when` or a switch expression, is dropped the same way. The source has no default there, and the branch cannot fire unless a class changes under a running program.
- **Keys from the source case.** A branch key for one of these outcomes digests the constant's name or the string literal in place of the case key value. The site key digests the subject expression's window. Adding, removing or reordering a case then leaves every other case's key alone, which is what ADR 0031 meant.
- **Case labels as condition parts.** An outcome's role carries its label as condition parts (ADR 0037). A string literal is a literal part, so collector redaction covers it. An enum constant is a code part.
- **Throwing defaults.** Those confirmed are javac 21's `MatchException`, javac 17's `IncompatibleClassChangeError` and kotlinc's `NoWhenBranchMatchedException`. Only a rebuilt switch drops one. Its branch index keeps its place, it gets no probe slot, its edge goes to the original default unprobed, and the guard analysis gives it no outcome node.
- **Confirm every shape first.** Each lowering is confirmed with `javap` against the compilers this repo supports before it is coded: javac's mapping array, string switch and the `SwitchBootstraps` `invokedynamic` forms newer javac uses for pattern switches; kotlinc's `$WhenMappings` and string `when`; and whatever Scala 2 and Scala 3 emit for string and enum matches. A shape that does not match a confirmed one exactly stays as plain sites with numeric case keys. The agent never guesses a label.

## Considered options

- **Keeping the numeric keys and relying on each outcome's guarded lines.** Rejected: "case 3" is no more readable than "Branch 12", and the key keeps churning whenever a case is added.
- **Resolving labels on the server.** Rejected: the mapping lives in a class file the server never sees.
- **Keeping the lowering's jumps as sites beside the rebuilt one.** Rejected: a hash-collision fall-through that can never fire reads as never hit forever. That is the confident and wrong finding ADR 0025 exists to stop.

## Consequences

- Builds before and after this change give these outcomes different keys once, so their service dates start again.
- A mapping class that cannot be read, or a shape that differs from every confirmed one, leaves the numeric sites in place. The result is less readable, never wrong.
- An `equals` check kept as a site under the second rule keeps ADR 0031's key, which covers the jump opcode. kotlinc and scalac choose `ifeq` or `ifne` by body layout, so adding a case can move some of these keys. Only rebuilt sites promise that a case's key survives another case being added.
- A string label may be a value an adopter wants hidden. It travels as a literal part so that one redaction rule in the collector covers it along with every other literal.
- The last `equals` check in each hash bucket of a kotlinc `when` or scalac `match` keeps its outcome for the literal and gives the other no probe: only a different string with the same hash reaches it. It keeps its branch index, as a throwing default does, so it is neither listed nor counted. Found in a review on 2026-10-03; every case of a string `when` had read as one never-taken outcome.
- scalac maps a null subject into the `""` bucket of a `match` with a `case ""`, so a null reaching that bucket takes the unprobed side and is not counted.
- Amended on 2026-10-03 by ADR 0052: the shapes this record reads are read from the class file, not the received bytes, so an earlier transformer such as JaCoCo leaves them unchanged.

## Amended on 2026-10-03: an unread lowering was not "never wrong"

The consequence above that an unread shape "leaves the numeric sites in place. The result is less readable, never wrong" was not true. In a kotlinc string `when` or scalac string `match` whose lowering is not read, the collision side of the last `equals` check in each hash bucket kept its probe and read as never taken forever: the finding this record's third rejected option names. A compiler's throwing default stays as well, but ADR 0046 marks it `THROW_ONLY`, so it is no finding. That collision side is an unread shape of family `SWITCH_LOWERING` (ADR 0054); every other site of an unread lowering stays a plain numeric site, since it is reachable.

Found on the same day, a readability gap with no false finding: javac 25 at `--release 21` lowers an enum switch with a pattern case through `typeSwitch` with ConstantDynamic `EnumDesc` arguments rather than `enumSwitch`, and every javac read lowers a qualified enum label (`case Color.RED` under a sealed interface) the same way. `bootstrapSwitch` reads neither, so those cases keep numeric keys. Recorded in `STATUS.md` for after release.
