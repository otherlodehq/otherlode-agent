# Customer docs

The pages in this folder are the "Agent" section of the docs at
https://otherlode.dev/docs. After a `v*.*.*` tag's release, the `docs`
job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` copies this folder into
`otherlode.dev` at `src/content/docs/agent/<tag>/` and opens a pull
request there. Each release keeps its own copy, so the site serves every
release's docs and a changes page that diffs each release against the
one before it. otherlode.dev ADRs 0001 and 0002 have the reasons.

A change that alters what a customer sees or sets should change its page
here, in the same pull request. Operator and contributor material stays
in the README. Keep a page's file name across releases. A renamed file
reads as one page removed and another added, and the release menu cannot
link the two.

A page is a Markdown file with this frontmatter:

```md
---
title: Page title
description: One sentence for search results and link previews.
order: 10
---
```

`title` becomes the page's `h1`, so the Markdown starts at `##`. `order`
sorts the pages in this section, lowest first. The file name gives the
URL: `attach.md` is `/docs/agent/attach`. A file whose name starts with
`_` is not a page, and this README is not copied.

The site's CSP allows no inline script or style, so a page must not use
raw HTML with `<script>`, `<style>` or `style=`. The site's build fails
on them. To preview a page, copy it into a checkout of `otherlode.dev`
and run `npm run dev` there.
