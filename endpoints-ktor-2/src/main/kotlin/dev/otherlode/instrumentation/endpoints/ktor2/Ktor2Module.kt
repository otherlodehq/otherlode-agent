/**
 * Endpoint module for Ktor 2 (`ktor-2`), covering the `io.ktor:ktor-server-core-jvm` 2.x line.
 *
 * `Route.handle` is the registration hook: it runs once per handler lambda as application code
 * builds the routing tree, with the handler and the route it was attached to both in hand.
 * `Routing.executeResult` is the dispatch point: it runs once per matched request, before that
 * route's own handler pipeline runs, with the winning route already resolved. Both are advised
 * instead of the public `RoutingCallStarted` event, whose subscription would need advice to
 * implement a Kotlin function type; see [dev.otherlode.endpoints.ktor2.HandleAdvice]
 * for the full reasoning.
 *
 * The route node object itself is the identity this module keys endpoints under, since it is
 * exactly what both `handle` and `executeResult` hand over. A route selector that contributes
 * nothing to a path (headers, content type, query parameters, host, `AndRouteSelector`/
 * `OrRouteSelector`) means such a route merges with any sibling sharing the same path, an accepted
 * v1 simplification.
