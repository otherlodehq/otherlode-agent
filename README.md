# Otherlode

A Java agent that instruments a running JVM application to find code that's
reachable but never actually exercised at runtime: unused endpoints, methods
that are never invoked, and conditionals that only ever take one branch.

Attach it with `-javaagent`, run your app, and it reports which of those
probes never fired.

## How it works, briefly

- Method-level probes (ByteBuddy `Advice`) catch unused methods and classes.
- Endpoint modules for Spring MVC, Ktor, JAX-RS and the JDK's `HttpServer`
  count each endpoint where the framework matches a request to it, and list
  the endpoints it registered, so one never called shows up.
- Branch-level probes (raw ASM, woven into the same transform pass) catch
  conditionals and switches that only ever take one path.
- The agent batches hit counts and pushes them to a collector on a fixed
  interval (OTLP-style: delta batches plus an incremental probe manifest)
  instead of exposing them for scraping, so a collector can aggregate
  results across every instance in a fleet.

## Build

```
./gradlew build
```

Produces a shaded agent jar at `build/libs/otherlode-agent-<version>.jar` with
ByteBuddy, protobuf, the Kotlin standard library and the agent's own wire
classes relocated, so it won't collide with copies already on the target
application's classpath.

### Benchmark the transform-time analysis

```
./gradlew jmh
./gradlew jmh -Potherlode.benchmark.corpus=demo
./gradlew jmh -Potherlode.benchmark.corpus=demo,scala
```

A JMH benchmark in `src/jmh/kotlin` times the branch analyser over five
corpora of real class files: `demo`, `demo-spring`, `scala` (both Scala
fixture modules), `spring-webmvc` (the jar `demo-spring` resolves) and
`ktor-server-core` (the jar `endpoints-ktor-3` tests against). The first command runs all five, about 40
seconds each. `-Potherlode.benchmark.corpus` picks one or more by name. The
score is the average time to analyse the whole corpus once. Each run prints
the corpus's class count, so the time per class is the score divided by that
count. Results go to `build/results/jmh/results.txt`.

## Attach it to an app

```
-javaagent:/path/to/otherlode-agent-<version>.jar=serviceName=my-service,exportUrl=http://localhost:4319,includePackages=com.acme.myservice
```

Options (comma-separated `key=value`, `includePackages`/`excludePackages` use
`;` to separate multiple prefixes; a value cannot itself contain a comma, so
set one that needs to through the system property or environment variable
described below):

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `serviceName` | detected, else `unknown_service:java` | Reported to the collector. Falls back to OpenTelemetry's settings and then to detection; see "Reading OpenTelemetry's settings" below. |
| `serviceNamespace` | *(none)* | The group the service belongs to, as OpenTelemetry's `service.namespace`. A service is known by its namespace and its name together. Falls back to OpenTelemetry's settings. With none, the service is in the unspecified namespace. A name or namespace of `.` or `..` is ignored with a warning, since no URL can name it. |
| `serviceVersion` | *(none)* | Reported to the collector. Falls back to OpenTelemetry's `service.version` resource attribute. |
| `serviceInstanceId` | random UUID | Reported to the collector. Never read from OpenTelemetry's `service.instance.id`. |
| `environment` | *(none)*, `test` for a test run | Reported to the collector. Falls back to OpenTelemetry's `deployment.environment.name`, then `deployment.environment`, then `test` when `testRun` is on. |
| `exportUrl` | `http://localhost:4319` | Base URL of the collector. The exporter appends `/v1/otherlode/...` to it, so a path is kept but a query string or fragment is refused with a warning and the default is used. |
| `authToken` | *(none)* | Bearer token sent to the collector as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Prefer setting it through `OTHERLODE_AUTH_TOKEN` rather than this option: agent arguments are visible to every user on the host via `ps`, and an environment variable is not. |
| `flushIntervalSeconds` | `60` | How often deltas/manifest updates are sent, in whole seconds from 1 to 86400. Any other value falls back to the default with a warning. |
| `includePackages` | *(required)* | Only instrument types whose name starts with one of these prefixes, `;`-separated, written as dotted packages (`com.acme`, not `com.acme.*` or `com/acme`, which match nothing and are dropped with a warning). Without a usable prefix the agent logs an ERROR and stays disabled for the life of the JVM: nothing is instrumented and nothing is exported. The ERROR suggests the main class's package when it can find one. |
| `excludePackages` | *(none)* | Never instrument types whose name starts with one of these prefixes, `;`-separated, even if `includePackages` also matches them. Exclusion always wins. |
| `staticBaselineEnabled` | `false` | Scan the classpath once at startup (async, off the critical path) for classes under `includePackages` that never load at all. Off by default: a full classpath walk has a cost that scales with the classpath's size. |
| `enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to turn the agent off entirely: nothing is instrumented and nothing is exported. Meant to be set from `OTHERLODE_ENABLED` so a deployment can disable the agent without rebuilding the image that bakes in `-javaagent`. |
| `endpointsEnabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to switch off every framework endpoint module (Spring MVC, Ktor, JAX-RS, the JDK's `HttpServer`) at once. There are no per-framework flags. |
| `otelBridgeEnabled` | `false` | Also count the route OpenTelemetry's own HTTP server instrumentation resolved, for a framework no endpoint module covers. Off by default because it hooks OpenTelemetry internals rather than a framework's public registration API. Needs `endpointsEnabled`, which switches it off too. |
| `testRun` | `false` | Mark this run as a test run, for an agent in the JVM that runs your tests. A collector then leaves the run out of every finding about production and uses its call edges to name the tests that call production code. With no environment set, a test run reports to `test`. See "Name the tests that call your code" below. |

## Where an option's value comes from

Every option above can be set three ways, in this precedence order: the
agent-args string wins, then a JVM system property, then an environment
variable, then the option's own default. A blank value at any level counts
as unset and falls through to the next one.

The property and environment variable names are derived mechanically from
the option name: split it on camelCase boundaries, then join with `.` and
lowercase it for the property (prefixed `otherlode.`), or join with `_` and
uppercase it for the environment variable (prefixed `OTHERLODE_`). For example:

- `serviceName` → system property `otherlode.service.name`, environment variable `OTHERLODE_SERVICE_NAME`
- `flushIntervalSeconds` → system property `otherlode.flush.interval.seconds`, environment variable `OTHERLODE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`

## Reading OpenTelemetry's settings

A service that already runs OpenTelemetry has named itself once in
OpenTelemetry's settings. Otherlode reads those, so its findings carry the same
name as the service's traces. The service name, the namespace, the version and the
environment each come from the first of these sources that gives a value
that is not blank, and each value is trimmed:

1. Otherlode's own three sources above: the agent-args string, the
   `otherlode.*` system property, then the `OTHERLODE_*` environment variable.
2. OpenTelemetry's own settings, resolved as its Java agent resolves them:
   each of `otel.service.name` and `otel.resource.attributes` from its
   system property, else its environment variable (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`,
   `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`); the name from `otel.service.name`, else
   `service.name` in the attributes.
3. For the name only, detection in the order OpenTelemetry's Java agent
   uses: the Spring Boot application name (a `--spring.application.name`
   argument, the `spring.application.name` system property,
   `SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME`, then `application.properties`,
   `application.yml` and `application.yaml` in the working directory and on
   the class path, then `bootstrap.*` on the class path), then the main
   jar's `Implementation-Title`, then the main jar's file name.
4. For the name only, OpenTelemetry's default `unknown_service:java`.
5. For the environment only, `test` when `testRun` is on.

The resource-attribute keys are `service.name`, `service.namespace`, `service.version`, and
`deployment.environment.name`, then the older `deployment.environment`.
Each OpenTelemetry setting comes whole from one place, so a set
`otel.resource.attributes` system property hides `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
entirely, and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` wins over a `service.name` inside that
system property. A list is `key=value` pairs split by commas, with
percent-encoded values. If any pair is not `key=value`, Otherlode ignores the
whole list and logs a warning, as the OpenTelemetry specification says. Set
an Otherlode option to name the service differently in Otherlode on purpose,
since Otherlode's own sources win.

In Kubernetes, the OpenTelemetry Operator sets `service.namespace` from the
pod's `resource.opentelemetry.io/service.namespace` annotation, or else from
the pod's Kubernetes namespace, and passes it in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`.
Otherlode reads it from there. Set `OTHERLODE_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` to override it.
Otherlode never works out a namespace for itself.

Otherlode needs somewhere to send data to. See the `demo` module below for a
minimal stub, or point it at a real collector.

## Try the demo

```
./gradlew :demo:runDemo
./gradlew :demo:runSpringDemo
```

Runs a stub collector, an instrumented demo server (`/checkout`, always hit
one way; `/promo`, never called), and a client that drives the server, all as
separate JVM processes. On shutdown, the stub collector prints a report of
probes that were never hit and any classes it had to skip. `runSpringDemo`
does the same for the Spring Boot fat-jar demo.

A never-hit branch prints as its condition, the result that never happened,
and the lines that run only through that result. Its branch index stays in
brackets at the end. A condition reads the way the code just after the check
sees it, which for a plain `if` is the condition the source wrote. The demo's
two checkout conditions print like this:

```
NEVER HIT: handleCheckout (DemoServerMain.kt:71) `System.getenv("ENABLE_LEGACY_DISCOUNT") == "true"` was never true, only path to DemoServerMain.kt:72 (instance 17e3afc3-76f1-435c-b30a-5e594350530f, class 0, probe 10) [BRANCH branch#1]
NEVER HIT: handleCheckout (DemoServerMain.kt:78) `discounted > 100.0` was never true, only path to DemoServerMain.kt:79, partly to DemoServerMain.kt:92 (instance 17e3afc3-76f1-435c-b30a-5e594350530f, class 0, probe 12) [BRANCH branch#3]
```

A condition carries the string literals the source compared against, such
as `"ENABLE_LEGACY_DISCOUNT"` above, and so does a string `when` case. The
agent sends them as written; it has no redaction setting of its own. The
collector can replace them before they leave your network (collector ADR
0001), so a deployment that needs redaction sends through a collector with
it switched on. An agent that posts straight to a backend sends literals in
clear.

Some outcomes are real but not worth a person's time when they never run.
The agent reads each outcome's path in the bytecode and marks it with a
routine kind (ADR 0046): the null side of a null check that calls nothing
(`default never used`), a path that only builds and throws an exception
(`only throws`), or the exception-path copy of a `finally` body (`finally
copy`). The report keeps these out of the never-hit list and the headline,
and lists them apart under `ROUTINE OUTCOMES`. The demo client always sends
a total, so the null checks in `totalParam` never see null and print there:

```
ROUTINE [default never used]: totalParam (DemoServerMain.kt:136) `value != null` was never false, guards no code of its own (instance 4aef3090-5d33-4ab7-897e-f6170b0ab9a5, class 0, probe 17) [branch#14]
```

A top-level function prints with its file, as `handleCheckout
(DemoServerMain.kt)`, rather than as a member of `DemoServerMainKt`, the
class kotlinc makes for the file. The agent reads that from the kind kotlinc
writes into each class's `kotlin.Metadata`, never from the name (ADR 0041).
The demo also has two files that `@file:JvmMultifileClass` joins into one
class, `DemoText`. That class holds only forwarders, one per function, and
the code lives in one part class per file. The checkout handler calls
`checkoutGreeting` through the forwarder, and the agent follows the call to
the part, so the forwarder is marked generated and never reported. Nothing
calls `farewellNote`, so its part never loads and prints by its file:

```
NEVER LOADED: DemoTextFarewell.kt (methods: farewellNote)
```

Some findings are about a whole class, not a method in it (otherlode-server's
ADR 0034). `main` names `AuditLog` and `ReceiptPrinter` through class
literals, which load a class without initialising it. `AuditLog` is an
object, so its static initialiser is where its one instance is made; that
never runs, so the class is never initialised. `ReceiptPrinter` has no
static initialiser, but it declares an instance method and none of its
constructors ran, so it is never instantiated. The report prints both, and
the never-hit list leaves out the methods that can only run through them:

```
NEVER INITIALISED: com.example.demo.server.AuditLog (methods: constructor, record) (instances loading: 1)
NEVER INSTANTIATED: com.example.demo.server.ReceiptPrinter (methods: constructor, print, print$lambda$0) (instances loading: 1)
```

A static initialiser is never a row of its own, and a constructor is a row
only as an unused overload: one that never ran while another constructor
of its class did. The checkout handler builds every `Money` from pence, so
`Money`'s pounds-and-pence constructor is one. `Price` has one constructor
with `@JvmOverloads`, and the checkout always passes its scale, so the
extra overload kotlinc adds never runs either. The agent marks that
overload generated, so it is never reported. Constructors print with their
parameter types:

```
NEVER HIT: com.example.demo.server.Money#constructor(int, int):10 [CONSTRUCTOR, unused overload] (instance 17e3afc3-76f1-435c-b30a-5e594350530f, class 5, probe 1)
```

The last report groups those never-hit probes into unreached clusters: a
root that's either reached from code that does run, never called at all, a
branch outcome that never ran in a method that did, or a class that holds a
class finding, plus every never-hit method beneath it whose only callers are
also in the cluster. `/promo`'s handler calls a helper that calls a
repository method neither the handler nor anything else ever reaches, so it
prints as one four-method cluster: the handler, its helper, and the
repository's method and constructor. The repository class never loads at
all in this demo, and the cluster holds every method of it, so it prints
once as a whole class with its finding. A call into a class counts as a
call into its static initialiser, which is why the whole class follows the
handler into the cluster; the initialiser itself is never listed or
counted. The handler is a named class, so the endpoint record names its
`handle` method and the route is printed beside the root; nothing in the
demo's own code calls `handle`, only the server does, which is why the root
is uncalled rather than reached from hit:

```
UNREACHED CLUSTER: root com.example.demo.server.PromoHandler#handle (uncalled), 4 methods, 1 never-loaded classes routes=[* /promo]
  com.example.demo.server.PromoRepository (whole class, never loaded, 2 methods)
  applyPromoCode (DemoServerMain.kt)
  com.example.demo.server.PromoHandler#handle
```

`/checkout` is registered the other way, as a function reference that
Kotlin converts to the `HttpHandler` interface through `invokedynamic`.
That handler is a hidden class with no stable name. The agent records
which method it calls as the JDK spins it (ADR 0035), so the two shapes
sit side by side in the endpoint report: `* /promo` names
`PromoHandler#handle`, and `* /checkout` names
`DemoServerMainKt#handleCheckout`.

A second cluster starts at the branch the demo never takes. The untaken
side of the checkout handler's `if` constructs `LegacyDiscountCalculator`,
calls its `apply`, and reads a static field of `LegacyRates`, which runs
that object's static initialiser and so its constructor. Each of those
calls sits behind that one outcome, so the outcome is the root, printed the
way the never-hit report prints it, followed by the method that holds it.
Deleting that side of the `if` removes both classes whole:

```
UNREACHED CLUSTER: root `System.getenv("ENABLE_LEGACY_DISCOUNT") == "true"` was never true, only path to DemoServerMain.kt:72, in handleCheckout (DemoServerMain.kt:71) (untaken outcome), 3 methods, 2 never-loaded classes routes=[* /checkout]
  com.example.demo.server.LegacyDiscountCalculator (whole class, never loaded, 2 methods)
  com.example.demo.server.LegacyRates (whole class, never loaded, 1 methods)
```

A class that holds a class finding roots a cluster of its own when nothing
calls it, or when a method that ran does. It is listed only when the
cluster holds more than the methods the finding folds, since the class
findings report already names the class. A lambda body goes with the
methods that create it: `ReceiptPrinter`'s `print` hands a lambda to
`joinToString`, and kotlinc compiles that lambda to a static method of the
class, which folds into the class finding with `print`. So neither
`AuditLog` nor `ReceiptPrinter` roots a listed cluster.

A never-hit method called from a method that ran, and not from behind an
untaken outcome, is a root "reached from hit", and the report names the
callers after it. The checkout handler also calls its response helper
through a function reference; the class the compiler generates for that
reference is reached from the handler and never appears in a cluster.

## Run the demo against a real collector

```
./gradlew :demo:runDemoStack
./gradlew :demo:runSpringDemoStack
./gradlew :demo:runShapesStack
```

Runs the same instrumented demo server and client, but against a real
collector instead of the stub, then prints what the backend behind it
reports. `runSpringDemoStack` does the same for the Spring Boot fat-jar
demo, as service `otherlode-spring-demo`. `runShapesStack` runs three short
programs one after another, each as its own service: `otherlode-shapes`
touches Java anonymous classes and a lambda, a companion object, a data
class and a suspend function, each with a part that never runs, and
`otherlode-fixtures-scala2` and `otherlode-fixtures-scala3` call some of the Scala
fixture modules' `Driver` methods and leave the rest. Each prints: probe and class counts, the never-hit probes, the never-loaded,
never-initialised and never-instantiated classes, and the unreached
clusters. It expects a collector at `http://localhost:4319` and the
otherlode-server read API at `http://localhost:4320`, which is what
otherlode-server's `docker compose --profile stack up --build` provides. Every
address and credential can be overridden:

| Property | Default |
|---|---|
| `-PotherlodeEndpoint` | `http://localhost:4319` |
| `-PotherlodeAgentToken` | `local-stack-agent-token` |
| `-PotherlodeServerUrl` | `http://localhost:4320` |
| `-PotherlodeServerReadApiKey` | `otl_stack-read-key-for-local-dev-only`, the stack's read key; the demo only reads the server's API. |
| `-PotherlodeServiceVersion` | `stack-demo`, `spring-stack-demo` for the Spring demo, `shapes-stack-demo` for the shapes run |

The defaults match the compose stack's own development defaults, so with
the stack up it works with no arguments. Each run registers as a new
instance, and the server keeps everything it has seen, so the report
covers every run of that service and version so far; pass a fresh
`-PotherlodeServiceVersion` to start a clean slate.

The demo runs in the unspecified namespace. To run it in a named one, set
`OTHERLODE_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` in the environment of the Gradle command; the
tasks pass it to the demo server, and the report names the namespace.

## Test your app against the agent

The `testkit` module is an embeddable collector for your own tests. It
speaks the agent's real wire protocol, so the agent under test runs exactly
as it does in production: start the collector, point the agent's `exportUrl=`
at it, exercise your app, then ask the collector what it saw.

```kotlin
OtherlodeTestCollector.start().use { collector ->
    // Launch your app with
    // -javaagent:otherlode-agent.jar=exportUrl=${collector.exportUrl},flushIntervalSeconds=1,includePackages=com.acme
    // and exercise it, then:
    collector.awaitProbe("com.acme.OrderService", "checkout", Duration.ofSeconds(10))
    collector.awaitNextFlush(Duration.ofSeconds(10))

    assertTrue(collector.wasHit("com.acme.OrderService", "checkout"))
    assertFalse(collector.wasHit("com.acme.OrderService", "applyLegacyPromo"))
    assertTrue(collector.neverHit().isEmpty())
}
```

Class names are the dotted binary names the manifest carries
(`com.acme.OrdersKt` for a Kotlin file's top-level functions,
`com.acme.Outer$Inner` for a nested class). A function in a
`@file:JvmMultifileClass` file lives in its part class, such as
`com.acme.Orders__OrderTotalsKt`, not in the facade Kotlin callers name.

Queries cover methods (`wasHit`, `hitCount`, `neverHit`, `skippedClasses`),
branch outcomes (`neverHitRoutineOutcomes`), classes
(`neverInitialized`, `neverInstantiated`), endpoints
(`wasCalled`, `callCount`, `neverCalled`, `endpoints`,
`disabledEndpointModules`), optional parameters (`omissionCount`,
`neverSupplied`, `alwaysSupplied`), the call graph (`unreachedClusters`),
dependencies (`dependency`, `unloadedDependencies`,
`unreferencedDependencies`, `unreachedDependencies`, `absentReferences`) and,
when the agent runs with `staticBaselineEnabled=true`, `neverLoaded`. Waits cover the next
flush, a settled state, a probe, an endpoint and a dependency
(`awaitNextFlush`, `awaitSettled`, `awaitProbe`, `awaitEndpoint`,
`awaitDependency`, `awaitDependenciesListed`). Asking about a probe the
collector has never seen throws `UnknownProbeException` rather than
answering `false`; the message says whether the class was skipped, loaded
where no transformer saw it, declared by the static baseline but never
loaded, instrumented but without that method, or never mentioned at all.
That keeps "genuinely dead" and "no idea" from ever looking the same. A
payload the collector cannot accept is listed by `rejectedPayloads`, and
every other query throws while there is one.

With JUnit 5, `@ExtendWith(OtherlodeExtension::class)` starts one collector
for the test JVM on port 4319 (`otherlode.testkit.port` overrides it) and
injects it into any test that asks for an `OtherlodeTestCollector`. Run the
test task with `-javaagent` pointing at that port. The collector accepts one
agent: with `maxParallelForks` above 1, every fork's agent would post to the
same port, so give each fork its own port and endpoint or run one fork. A test
that launches a child JVM with the agent needs a collector of its own, started
with `OtherlodeTestCollector.start()`, for the same reason. Anything else that
posts to the port is rejected, and fails every query for the rest of the run.

JaCoCo's agent can sit before or after this one on the command line. Gradle's
`jacoco` plugin puts its agent after a test task's `jvmArgs`, and that order is
fine. This agent runs after every agent whose transformer is not
retransformation-capable, JaCoCo's included, and reads each class's shape from
its class file, so neither tool's results change. An agent that adds or
reorders a method's conditional jumps ahead of this one, as AspectJ's weaver
can, leaves that method with its entry probe but no branch probes.

The first heartbeat has 15 seconds to arrive; set
`otherlode.testkit.startup.timeout.seconds` to change that.

The testkit and the agent are one version. The collector rejects a payload
from an agent of another version, and the failure names both versions: use the
testkit of the agent's version. Result types and enums only grow in a minor
release, so a `when` over `ProbeKind`, `GeneratedBy`, `RoutineKind`,
`UnreadShape`, `RootKind`, `ClassFinding`, `EndpointDiscoverySource`,
`DependencyDiscoverySource` or `DependencyUsage` needs an `else` branch.
`GeneratedBy`, `RoutineKind` and `UnreadShape` have no "none" value: the field
on `ProbeRef` is null when the probe has no mark.

The same collector works from Java:

```java
try (OtherlodeTestCollector collector = OtherlodeTestCollector.start()) {
    // Launch your app with -javaagent:otherlode-agent.jar=exportUrl=<collector.getExportUrl()>,...
    collector.awaitProbe("com.acme.OrderService", "checkout", Duration.ofSeconds(10));
    assertTrue(collector.wasHit("com.acme.OrderService", "checkout"));
    assertTrue(collector.neverHit().isEmpty());
}
```

The module isn't published yet. Build the jar with
`./gradlew :testkit:shadowJar` and put it on your test classpath. It bundles the wire classes and
protobuf-java under `dev.otherlode.testkit.shaded`, so the only dependency it
brings onto your test classpath is kotlin-stdlib, and never the agent itself,
which runs from its `-javaagent` jar.

## Name the tests that call your code

Production holds no test classes, so a method that only your tests call
reads as uncalled, the same as a method that nothing calls. To have the
collector name those tests, run the agent in your test JVM too, against the
same collector, with `testRun=true` (ADR 0050):

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
tasks.test {
    jvmArgs(
        "-javaagent:/path/to/otherlode-agent.jar=serviceName=my-service,testRun=true," +
            "staticBaselineEnabled=true,serviceInstanceId=my-service-unit-tests," +
            "includePackages=com.acme.myservice,exportUrl=http://localhost:4319",
    )
}
```

- `serviceName` and `serviceNamespace` must match production's, or the
  test run belongs to another service.
- `includePackages` must cover your test classes as well as the production
  code. They usually share packages, so production's value works.
- The `jacoco` plugin can stay applied: the order of the two agents changes
  neither tool's results, as "Test your app against the agent" above explains.
- `staticBaselineEnabled=true` sends call edges from every test class on
  the classpath, not only from the tests that ran.
- Pin `serviceInstanceId` once per test task. The collector reads each
  test instance's newest complete scan and its newest run's manifest, so a
  pinned id gives one current picture per task. A random id makes every
  test JVM its own instance, and its edges stay until the run is pruned.
  With `maxParallelForks` above 1, the forks of one task share the id, so
  the newest fork's manifest hides the others'. The scan covers every test
  class whichever fork sends it.
- A test run waits up to 15 seconds at shutdown for its scan to end, after
  its final flush. A test JVM often exits before the scan ends. So a test
  task can take that much longer to finish, more when the collector is slow
  or unreachable. A collector with an environment of its own counts each
  test-run payload as an environment mismatch.
- Leave the environment unset in the test JVM, including
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` and `OTHERLODE_ENVIRONMENT` that CI may pass
  down. The `test` default is what keeps a test run apart from production
  if a collector drops the flag.
- Set `staticBaselineEnabled=true` in production too. Without a complete
  production scan, the collector cannot rule out a caller in a production
  class that never loaded. It then names the tests but does not call the
  method "called only by tests".

A collector built before `test_run` existed drops the flag when its
redaction is on. The run then reaches the backend as an ordinary run in the
`test` environment, apart from production's. If that collector also stamps
its environment with `upsert`, the test run lands in production's
environment. So update the collector before you turn `testRun` on.

## Which compilers' output the agent reads

The agent tells a compiler's generated code (a data class's `copy`, a case
class's `productElement`, a suspend function's state machine) from yours by
the exact body the compiler wrote. Those bodies change between compiler
releases, so the marks are exact only for releases the agent was checked
against, with each one's output run through the real analyser (ADR 0055):

- kotlinc 1.9.25, 2.1.21, 2.2.21 and 2.4.20. They stand for 1.9 to 2.4;
  2.1.21 stands for the releases that default to `-jvm-default=disable`.
- javac 17, 21 and 25.
- scalac 2.12 and 2.13, version-blind: a Scala 2 class does not name its
  compiler, so the rules read every variant found from 2.12.18 to 2.12.21 and
  from 2.13.14 to 2.13.18.
- Scala 3 from 3.3.3 to 3.9.0, one release at a time. A Scala 3 class names
  the release that wrote it, and the agent reads the releases listed in
  `src/main/resources/dev/otherlode/scala3-read-releases.txt`.

Code in the outline of compiler output whose body the agent has not read, from
any other compiler or a release that changed a shape, is reported as an unread
shape: it is probed and counted, but never called dead code and never part of
an unreached cluster, and the collector lists it apart. The agent logs a summary of unread shapes on its
first flush, naming the Scala 3 releases it has not read. A scheduled CI job
compiles the fixtures with the newest release of each compiler, so a change
in a shape fails a build before it reaches a report.

## Design notes

`docs/adr/` records the decisions behind the agent that are hard to reverse
or surprising without context (why probes are a dense per-class array, why
counts are cumulative and merged with `max()`, why some classes are skipped
and reported rather than silently zero). `CONTEXT.md` is the glossary the
agent, the collector, and those records share.

## Status

- Static attach (`-javaagent`) only; no dynamic/runtime attach yet.
- Nothing is published to a package repository yet, the agent jar and
  `testkit` included; both are built from this repo.
- Branch tracking covers two-outcome conditional jumps and
  `TABLESWITCH`/`LOOKUPSWITCH`; `GOTO`/`JSR` aren't tracked (no second
  outcome to observe).
- A small number of classes can't be safely instrumented (for example,
  Kotlin files using `@file:JvmName`). These are skipped and reported, not
  silently dropped from coverage.
- Wire schema (`src/main/proto/otherlode/v1/otherlode.proto`) is published
  to the Buf Schema Registry as `buf.build/otherlode/otherlode` for external
  consumers (e.g. a separately-versioned collector).

## Licence

Apache License 2.0; see `LICENSE`. The agent jar bundles Byte Buddy (with
ASM), protobuf-java, the Kotlin standard library, and the JetBrains
annotations, relocated; their licence texts are under `licenses/` here and
`META-INF/licenses/` in the jar, and `NOTICE` lists them.
