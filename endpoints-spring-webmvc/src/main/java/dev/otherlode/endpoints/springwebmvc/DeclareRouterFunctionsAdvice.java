/**
 * Woven onto the exit of {@code RouterFunctionMapping.afterPropertiesSet()}, which fills the
 * private {@code routerFunction} field from every {@code RouterFunction} bean in the application
 * context, unless the mapping was built with a router function, which leaves it as given. Either
 * way the field is set when this method returns, before any request is dispatched.
 *
 * <p>{@code routerFunction} is bound as a plain {@code Object}, never as {@code RouterFunction}:
 * this class carries no symbolic reference to that type at all. The object is handed unopened to
 * {@link OtherlodeEndpoints#declare}, which routes it to {@code SpringWebMvcModule.declare}, the one
 * piece of this module's own code that knows how to walk it. A {@code RouterFunction} only
 * reveals its routes to a visitor it accepts, something advice itself cannot implement, so this
 * takes a second seam call instead of reading registration arguments the way {@link
 * RegisterHandlerMethodAdvice} and {@link RegisterUrlHandlerAdvice} do.
 *
 * <p>This method is deliberately one flat body with no private helper method of its own; see
 * {@link RegisterHandlerMethodAdvice}'s Javadoc for why.
